He is a young man, city-born, who settled five years ago in the California north. Fascinated by the place, the people, the minutiae of life in the backwoods, he has put together an 'everyday history' of his own particular 'somewhere'...the coastal hills near the Oregon border. <br><br>In a loving narrative, he tells us of the day-to-day story of the ordinary people, animals, and plants that have lived in this place. What an everyday Indian did for livelihood and play. What happens to a forest as it grows and to an animal as it hunts or is hunted. How Russian trappers, Spanish seamen, and Anglo gold miners swept through, changing the lives of the otters, the seals, the forests...and the Indians. How homesteaders, loggers, and finally today's new pioneers came to stay, and how their lifestyles affected the landscape and were affected by it. We learn firsthand about the working day of lumberjacks, professional soldiers, elk (and potatoes); about the 'place' in the woods of rivers, coyotes, the tan oak acorn; and about life on the homesteads and in frontier towns. <br><br> In his fine pen-and-ink drawings, Mark Livingston transmutes old historical prints and advertisements, together with new glimpses of the countryside and its creatures, into a feeling illumination of the narrative.</p><p></p><h2>The Trip: Andy Warhol&#39;s Plastic Fantastic Cross-Country Adventure</h2><p>From the author of <i>Strapless </i>and <i>Guest of Honor</i>, a book about a little-known road trip Andy Warhol took from New York to LA in 1963, and how that journey&#x2014;and the numerous artists and celebrities he encountered&#x2014;profoundly influenced his life and art.<br><br>In 1963, up-and-coming artist Andy Warhol took a road trip across America. What began as a madcap, drug-fueled romp became a journey that took Warhol on a kaleidoscopic adventure from New York City, across the vast American heartland, all the way to Hollywood and back.<br> <br>With locations ranging from a Texas panhandle truck stop to a Beverly Hills mansion, from the beaches of Santa Monica to a Photomat booth in Albuquerque, <i>The Trip</i> captures Warhol&#x2019;s interactions with Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, Marcel Duchamp, Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis Presley, and Frank Sinatra.

In fact, he was a prosperous illustrator, living in a private townhouse on Lexington Avenue and Eighty-Ninth Street. The block was developed in 1888 by New York&#x2019;s aristocratic Rhinelander family, wealthy landowners who commissioned the architect Henry Hardenbergh to build six attached Northern Renaissance Revival houses on one of their properties in uptown Manhattan. Hardenbergh had designed the legendary Dakota apartment building on the Upper West Side, and he would go on to build some of the city&#x2019;s greatest hotels, including the Waldorf and the Plaza, among other landmarks. Decorated with brightly colored stone facades, arches, and balustrades, the buildings he erected for the Rhinelanders looked like dwellings in a fairy-tale village.<br> <br>Sadly, these storybook houses deteriorated over the years. In 1931, Lexington Avenue was widened, narrowing the sidewalk and forcing the buildings to be stripped of the stairs that led to their parlor-floor entrances. Most of the residences in the row turned into rooming houses and offices, but Andy saw the potential in these quaint old buildings and claimed one as his home. He moved in and filled four floors with his unusual possessions. One of his favorite pastimes was scouring antique stores and art galleries for new acquisitions. His collection included a variety of penny arcade machines that sprayed perfume, tested strength, and dispensed gumballs; carousel horses; stuffed peacocks; a phrenological head; a giant, somewhat sinister-looking Punch figure; a cigar-store Indian; Tiffany lamps; neoclassical furniture; and the beginnings of an art collection, including a distinctive double portrait of Andy and his friend Ted Carey that had been painted by the artist Fairfield Porter. The friends thought that they could cut the painting in half and have two portraits for the price of one, but Porter, anticipating their plan, placed them so close together that it was impossible to separate them.<br> <br>The parlor floor, the house&#x2019;s public space, had two rooms&#x2014;a small one overlooking Lexington Avenue, and a larger, paneled living room in the back. Andy described the rooms as &#x201c;kind of schizo&#x201d; because he designated the smaller space for his commercial work, his freelance illustration assignments, while he claimed the bigger room as his art studio and salon, the place where he did his real painting. His mother, Julia, and their ever-growing population of cats named Sam were installed in rooms on the street-level floor of the pale blue building, which contained a homey kitchen and an adjacent bedroom. His bedroom, outfitted with a brand-new four-poster bed, was on the third floor, and the other upstairs rooms were used for additional studio space and storage.<br> <br>Andy&#x2019;s Upper East Side address, shopping sprees, and expanding art collection were proof of his success, but he wasn&#x2019;t satisfied. He still considered himself a work in progress, a man who was going places but had not yet arrived. When one considers where Andy had started in life, the extent to which he had already transformed himself was nothing short of miraculous.<br> <br>Andy was the youngest son of Julia and her husband, Ondrej Warhola, Eastern European immigrants (specifically, Ruthenians), who came from Mikov�, a tiny village in the mountains of Slovakia. At the turn of the twentieth century, young Mikovians realized that the only way to move up was to move out. Nineteen-year-old Ondrej did just that in 1906 when, like many of his countrymen, he traveled to America in search of fortune. He worked in Pittsburgh for three years before returning to Mikov� with his hard-earned bankroll.<br> <br>Strong, blond, handsome, and prosperous by his village&#x2019;s standards, he attracted the attentions of every mother with a marriageable daughter. But it was seventeen-year-old Julia Zavacky, a golden-haired spitfire, who immediately caught his eye. Smitten, Ondrej proposed, only to be rejected. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Julia was a free spirit who loved to sing and tell stories, and she was not yet ready to become a wife. Knowing that suitable suitors were hard to come by in Slovakian villages, her practical parents pressured Julia into accepting Ondrej&#x2019;s proposal.<br> <br>The couple soon settled into the grinding routine of village life&#x2014;work, work, and more work. Three years later, Ondrej came to the sobering realization that there was still no future in Mikov�. In 1912, he returned to America, promising to send for his wife and their infant daughter as soon as he had saved enough money. Nine years passed&#x2014;years of war, deprivation, and heartbreak for Julia, who lost both her parents and her daughter to illness&#x2014;before she took matters into her own hands and borrowed the money she needed to join her absent husband.<br> <br>The Warholas reunited in 1921 and settled in Pittsburgh, a grim, gray, industrial city covered with so much smoke and fog that its inhabitants lived under a cloud of perpetual darkness. They moved into cheap tenement housing with primitive outdoor plumbing, and they struggled to get by on Ondrej&#x2019;s wages. The couple welcomed a son, Paul, in 1922, followed by John in 1925. Paul and John resembled their stalwart father, but Andrej, the Warholas&#x2019; third son, was like a changeling&#x2014;one of those enchanted infants from gypsy folklore whom the fairies substituted for a human child when the mother wasn&#x2019;t looking. Baby Andy, who was born on August 6, 1928, was so fair and fragile that he seemed to come from another world. Julia was charmed by her cherubic infant and instantly started spoiling him. Her older boys were born knowing how to take care of themselves and were constantly hatching schemes to make money, whether selling newspapers or delivering ice. Andy, on the other hand, was a delicate, introspective child who needed all the special attention that Julia gladly gave him.<br> <br>Despite his mother&#x2019;s coddling, Andy learned early that hard work and thrift were the key to survival in Depression-era Pittsburgh. When Ondrej lost his job, forcing him to tighten his already taut belt, the hard times only made him work harder at whatever job he could find, and to save even more of what little he earned. By 1934 he had put aside enough money to buy half of a two-family house on Dawson Street, in the working-class section of Oakland. The Warholas rented their second floor to generate income, but the rest of the small house and yard, including a garden in the back for Julia, was their palace, an immigrant family&#x2019;s American dream come true.<br> <br>Although Andy was bright, he was also shy and fearful, and he preferred quiet games with the neighborhood girls to the rough-and-tumble activities his brothers enjoyed with other boys. The children&#x2019;s school, Holmes Elementary, was down the street from their house, so the brothers came home for lunch every day. Julia usually served Campbell&#x2019;s Soup, and tomato was Andy&#x2019;s favorite variety. When not in school, he spent his time drawing, coloring, and cutting out paper dolls. His mother rewarded his best pictures with praise and Hershey bars, promoting an insatiable sweet tooth that would stay with him the rest of his life. Julia thought of herself as an artist, too, and she made colorful floral bouquets out of paper and tin cans that she sold to housewives looking for decorative touches for their modest homes.<br> <br>The Warholas acknowledged that Andy was spoiled, but no one in the family seemed to mind his favored status. When, at the age of seven, he asked for a movie projector, his brothers were taken aback by the unusual request, but were not at all surprised when their resourceful mother found the money to buy one secondhand. Andy projected cartoons on the wall, turning the modest Dawson Street living room into his own private picture palace.<br> <br>Watching cartoons at home was no substitute for seeing stars on the big screen, and Saturdays brought happy outings to the local movie theater. It was there that Shirley Temple flashed her dimples and dazzled devoted fans like Andy with her adorable song-and-dance routines. The fabled child star had a lot to sing about in 1936: her movies, including Bright Eyes, The Little Colonel, Captain January, and her most recent hit, The Poor Little Rich Girl, were so popular that Twentieth Century Fox was paying her an astonishing $50,000 per film.<br> <br>As much as Andy enjoyed the star&#x2019;s fanciful movies, he always dreaded the inevitable moment when a father, or some other parental stand-in, would rush in at the end of the film to claim the curly-topped little girl. &#x201c;It ruined everything,&#x201d; he complained. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to know who the father is.&#x201d; Even at an early age, Andy preferred fantasy to reality.<br> <br>Shirley Temple had poise, charm, beauty, talent, celebrity, wealth, and an unlimited variety of happy endings. Of course Andy wanted to be just like her. &#x201c;Morningstar,&#x201d; &#x201c;Andy Morningstar&#x201d;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what he called himself in his fantasies. He picked the name because it suggested bright beginnings, brilliance, fame. Alas, Andy was stuck with the less glamorous &#x201c;Warhola,&#x201d; and the decidedly prosaic life that went with it. &#x201c;Being born is like being kidnapped&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and sold into slavery,&#x201d; he lamented when he was older.<br> <br>Andy escaped to the movies most Saturdays, but he spent every Sunday in church. Located in a neighborhood called Ruska Dolina, or the Rusyn Valley, Saint John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church was founded in 1910 by Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants who longed for the religious traditions they practiced in the old country. On Sundays, Julia and Andy rose early and walked a vigorous mile to make the first Mass at 7:00 a.m. They stayed at church the entire day, praying, socializing, and attending two more masses. Andy dutifully sat with his mother, staring at the magnificent iconostasis&#x2014;a wall of hand-painted icons that had been commissioned for the church&#x2019;s interior.<br> <br>Painted in vivid gold, blue, red, and other rich colors, the icons were beautiful to look at, but they were meant to be much more than pretty pictures. Icons were &#x201c;scripture to the illiterate,&#x201d; according to Saint Gregory the Dialogist, one of the early Roman popes. &#x201c;What writing presents to readers, this a picture presents to the unlearned,&#x201d; he explained. The images of saints and religious scenes had a visual language all their own&#x2014;an oversized forehead symbolized wisdom, full lips suggested eloquence, and large ears were the mark of a compassionate listener. The bright gold backgrounds haloing oversized heads indicated divine light, or heaven. Every aspect of an icon, including its color and scale, was infused with meaning and story.<br> <br>The Warhola routine was interrupted in 1936, when eight-year-old Andy contracted rheumatic fever. It was a common illness in Pittsburgh, especially in the poorer neighborhoods, where children sometimes played near open sewage. But Andy&#x2019;s recovery was unusually slow, and there were complications. His hands shook, his legs were weak, his speech was slurred, and he had difficulty concentrating. Worse still, he couldn&#x2019;t stop fidgeting, and his limbs and torso constantly twitched in every direction. Eventually, the Warholas realized that something was terribly wrong. Only then did their doctor confirm that Andy&#x2019;s rheumatic fever had developed into Sydenham&#x2019;s chorea, a neurological disorder more commonly known as Saint Vitus&#x2019; Dance, a cruel name for an illness that causes its victims to move in an awkward parody of dancing.<br> <br>Thomas Sydenham, a famous seventeenth-century physician, first described the disorder in 1686, calling it &#x201c;a kind of convulsion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a constellation of involuntary, purposeless, rapid movements of the limbs; muscular weakness; and emotional lability.&#x201d; Two hundred and fifty years later, the treatment for Saint Vitus&#x2019; Dance was no more sophisticated than it was in Sydenham&#x2019;s time: patients had to endure a slow recuperation in a quiet environment, more commonly known as &#x201c;bed rest.&#x201d;<br> <br>Staying in bed for ten weeks would have been a challenging experience for most eight-year-old boys, but not for Andy. To him, the term &#x201c;bed rest&#x201d; sounded luxurious, something that would be prescribed for movie stars, not an ordinary child like Andy Warhola. Julia moved her son&#x2019;s bed into the first-floor dining room, where she and Ondrej normally slept, and showered him with attention, supplying comic books (Popeye and Dick Tracy were his favorites), movie magazines, candy, whatever he wanted. With his brothers&#x2019; help, Andy wrote to movie stars&#x2014;Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, Alice Faye, Carmen Miranda&#x2014;requesting publicity stills and autographed pictures, which, when received, he carefully pasted into a special scrapbook. Julia also encouraged Andy to do art projects, hoping such activities would help improve his motor skills.<br> <br>Eventually Andy recovered, but he had been transformed by his illness. He seemed even paler and more fragile than before, and the rashes that accompanied Sydenham&#x2019;s chorea affected his fair skin, which became so blotchy and irregular as he matured that the neighborhood children called him &#x201c;Andy the Red-Nosed Warhola.&#x201d; There were other changes, too. Andy had gone Hollywood during his &#x201c;intermission.&#x201d; He was starstruck by the celebrity stories he had read in all those movie magazines, and the photographs he collected, including a signed, tinted headshot of Shirley Temple (dedicated sweetly, if incorrectly, to &#x201c;Andrew Worhola&#x201d;), were his prized possessions.<br> <br>Post bed rest, Andy enjoyed drawing more than ever. Eventually, one of his teachers recognized that the odd little boy had real talent and arranged for him to attend free art classes at the Carnegie Museum on Saturday mornings. Although the museum was only a mile or so from Andy&#x2019;s house, it stood at the center of a completely different world from the working-class one he occupied. That part of Oakland, nicknamed &#x201c;the city beautiful,&#x201d; was Pittsburgh&#x2019;s showplace and cultural center, as well as a playground for its privileged millionaires.<br> <br>Every Saturday, Andy went to the museum to study art with his fellow Tam O&#x2019;Shanters, the name given to the group to honor its late Scottish American benefactor, the millionaire philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. He was envious of the pampered rich students who arrived at school in limousines&#x2014;fancy Packards and Pierce-Arrows. Yet when class started, talent was the great equalizer, and Andy quickly proved that he was &#x201c;more equal&#x201d; than the other students. The instructor, Joseph Fitzpatrick, called his work &#x201c;individual and unique,&#x201d; and he frequently held it up for the other students to admire. Even Ondrej recognized that his youngest son was a promising artist who was not destined to remain on Dawson Street. He planned accordingly, secretly putting aside money to fulfill another immigrant dream: Andy would be the first member of the Warhola family to go to college.<br> <br>Ondrej did not live long enough to see that dream come true. He became ill, possibly from a liver infection, and when he knew he was dying, he told Paul and John about Andy&#x2019;s college fund. It was understood that the older boys would take care of their gifted younger brother. Ondrej passed away in 1942, and two years later, the family faced another crisis when Julia was diagnosed with colon cancer. She underwent a colostomy, recovered, and continued to look after her three industrious sons. Paul and John went to work so they could support the family, while Andy raced through high school and finished in three years. Upon graduation, he announced that he would use his father&#x2019;s savings to study commercial art at the Carnegie Institute of ...</p><h2>Jews and the American Slave Trade</h2><p><p> The Nation of Islam's <i>Secret Relationship between Blacks and Jews </i>has been called one of the most serious anti-Semitic manuscripts published in years. This work of so-called scholars received great celebrity from individuals like Louis Farrakhan, Leonard Jeffries, and Khalid Abdul Muhammed who used the document to claim that Jews dominated both transatlantic and antebellum South slave trades. As Saul Friedman definitively documents in <i>Jews and the American Slave Trade, </i>historical evidence suggests that Jews played a minimal role in the transatlantic, South American, Caribbean, and antebellum slave trades.</p> <p> <i>Jews and the American Slave Trade </i>dissects the questionable historical technique employed in <i>Secret Relationship, </i>offers a detailed response to Farrakhan's charges, and analyzes the impetus behind these charges. He begins with in-depth discussion of the attitudes of ancient peoples, Africans, Arabs, and Jews toward slavery and explores the Jewish role hi colonial European economic life from the Age of Discovery tp Napoleon. His state-by-state analyses describe in detail the institution of slavery in North America from colonial New England to Louisiana. Friedman elucidates the role of American Jews toward the great nineteenth-century moral debate, the positions they took, and explains what shattered the alliance between these two vulnerable minority groups in America.</p> <p> Rooted in incontrovertible historical evidence, provocative without being incendiary, <i>Jews and the American Slave Trade </i>demonstrates that the anti-slavery tradition rooted in the Old Testament translated into powerful prohibitions with respect to any involvement in the slave trade. This brilliant exploration will be of interest to scholars of modern Jewish history, African-American studies, American Jewish history, U.S. history, and minority studies.</p></p><p><p> <em>Saul S. Friedman</em> is a professor of Jewish and Middle Eastern history at Youngstown State. He has written five award-winning documentaries and many articles and books on Jewish history, including: <em>Holocaust Literature</em>, <em>The Oberammergau Passion Play</em>, <em>Terezin Diary of Gonda Redlich</em>, and <em>Without Future: The Plight of Syrian Jewry</em>.</p><p> &#x201c;In this forceful and impassioned response to the Nation of Islam's <em>Secret Relationship between Blacks and Jews</em> (1991), Friedman (Youngstown State Univ.) combines his own extensive primary source research in American archives with the findings of David Brion Davis and hundreds of other distinguished scholars, to document conclusively "that Jews did not dominate the slave trade in the European colonies of South America and the Caribbean or the antebellum South"... Friedman's essential point remains clear: "when the import and sale of Africans was at its peak <em>Jews owned less than three-one hundredths of a percent, 0.03 percent of all the slaves in America</em>." All levels.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p> <p> &#x2014;E. R. Papenfuse, <em>Choice</em></p> <p> &#x201c;Saul Friedman&#x2019;s book is a trenchant, courageous, and scholarly refutation of that lethal mix of old-fashioned Jew-hatred and modern Holocaust envy which expresses itself in the allegation that Jews controlled the slave trade to and in America.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Edward Alexander, professor of English, Universeity of Washington, Seattle</p><br><br><p> &#x201c;The best antidote for myths and falsification of history is the truth. Prof. Friedman has provided just such an antidote to the calumnies of recent years about the role of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade. It is a scientific work that reveals the bad as well as the good. There is no doubt that this is the best survey of Jewish involvement in the slave trade to the Americas. It ends with a masterful analysis of the antipathy that has developed between Jews and African-Americans in the contemporary United States.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Howard L. Adelson, professor of medieval history, City University of New York</p><br><br><p> &#x201c;<em>Jews and the American Slave Trade</em> is a much needed response to an explosive issue that has been plagued with false charges and pseudo-scholarship. In a calm, logical and precise academic fashion, Dr. Friedman amply proves that Jews did not dominate the slave trade to and in America and, in fact, played a minuscule role even when part of the larger European, West Indian, North American, and South American slave societies. From ancient slavery to colonial mass transport, through each involved European nation to each American colony, Dr. Friedman&#x2019;s careful analysis is thoroughly documented and interestingly crafted. <em>Jews and the American Slave Trade</em> should be read by students, teachers, and the public at large.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Dr. David A.

She&#x2019;s a farmer. It&#x2019;s &#x201c;as big as a B-size potato.&#x201d; As her bombarded land turns white, she and her husband Martin huddle under a blanket and reminisce: the one-hundred-mile-per-hour winds; the eleven-inch rainfall (&#x201c;that broccoli turned out gorgeous&#x201d;); the hail disaster of 1977. The romance of farming washed away a long time ago, but the love? Never. In telling her story of working the land, coaxing good food from the fertile soil, Atina Diffley reminds us of an ultimate truth: we live in relationships&#x2014;with the earth, plants and animals, families and communities. </p><p>A memoir of making these essential relationships work in the face of challenges as natural as weather and as unnatural as corporate politics, her book is a firsthand history of getting in at the &#x201c;ground level&#x201d; of organic farming. One of the first certified organic produce farms in the Midwest, the Diffleys&#x2019; Gardens of Eagan helped to usher in a new kind of green revolution in the heart of America&#x2019;s farmland, supplying their roadside stand and a growing number of local food co-ops. This is a story of a world transformed&#x2014;and reclaimed&#x2014;one square acre at a time.</p><p>And yet, after surviving punishing storms and the devastating loss of fifth-generation Diffley family land to suburban development, the Diffleys faced the ultimate challenge: the threat of eminent domain for a crude oil pipeline proposed by one of the largest privately owned companies in the world, notorious polluters Koch Industries. As Atina Diffley tells her David-versus-Goliath tale, she gives readers everything from expert instruction in organic farming to an entrepreneur&#x2019;s manual on how to grow a business to a legal thriller about battling corporate arrogance to a love story about a single mother falling for a good, big-hearted man.<br></p></p><p><p>Atina Diffley is an organic farmer, author, public speaker and consultant. From 1973 to 2008, Atina and her husband Martin owned and operated Gardens of Eagan, one of the first certified organic produce farms in the Midwest. The award-winning video documentary Turn Here Sweet Corn, filmed when the 5th generation Diffley family farm was lost to development, focuses on the loss of greenbelt farmlands to suburbia. In 2006, when the Diffley&#x2019;s second farm was threatened with eminent domain by a Koch Industries crude oil pipeline, Atina worked with consumers and government to create the Minnesota Organic Mitigation Plan.

The front page (book cover) suggests a scope of approximately 1200 years, and the rise and fall of each empire is explained. A publisher's disclaimer also cautions that the ancients did not have newspapers (of course, they didn't even have paper!), but if they had, "they would have been reading...." Similar comments dart in and out of the news stories so that the entire tone is more human interest than ready reference. Such editorializing, however, only slightly distracts from the facts, which are accurate. Significant dates and events are all newsworthy. "Olympic Games Spoiled," "Caesar Stabbed," and "Hannibal Invades" are typical stories. The slightly oversized pages with decorative borders, sidebars, ads, and cartoons create an interesting layout. Many teachers would probably rejoice with the delivery of The Greek or Roman News as a project for a social-studies or whole-language unit. Kids can adopt this highly readable, albeit slightly sensationalized journalistic style.

Through the lens of Link?s vivid imagination, nothing is what it seems, and everything deserves a second look. From the multiple award-winning ?The Faery Handbag,? in which a teenager?s grandmother carries an entire village (or is it a man-eating dog?) in her handbag, to the near-future of ?The Surfer,? whose narrator (a soccer-playing skeptic) waits with a planeload of refugees for the aliens to arrive, Link?s stories are funny and full of unexpected insights and skewed perspectives on the world. Her fans range from Michael Chabon to Peter Buck of R.E.M. to Holly Black of <i>Spiderwick Chronicles</i> fame. Now teens can have their world rocked, too!</p><p>Kelly Link lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she and her husband, Gavin J. Grant, run Small Beer Press and publish the zine <i>Lady Churchill&#x2019;s Rosebud Wristlet</i> (www.lcrw.net)."Readers as yet unfamiliar with Link ("Magic for Beginners") will be excited to discover her singular voice in this collection of nine short stories, her first book for young adults. The first entry, &#x201c;The Wrong Grave,&#x201d; immediately demonstrates her rare talents: a deadpan narration that conceals the author's metafictional sleight-of-hand ("Miles had always been impulsive. I think you should know that right up front"); subjects that range from absurd to mundane, all observed with equidistant irony. Miles, hoping to recover the poems he's buried with his dead girlfriend, digs up what appears to be the wrong corpse ("It's a mistake anyone could make," interjects the narrator), who regains life and visits her mother, a lapsed Buddhist ("Mrs. Baldwin had taken her Buddhism very seriously, once, before substitute teaching had knocked it out of her"). Other stories have more overtly magical or intertextual themes; in each, Link's peppering of her prose with random associations dislocates readers from the ordinary. With a quirky, fairytale style evocative of Neil Gaiman, the author mingles the grotesque and the ethereal to make magic on the page."&#x2013;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b>, starred review<p></p><p>"Although some of Link&#x2019;s work appears in other YA and adult short-story anthologies, this is her first collection wholly aimed at a young-adult audience. Weirdly wonderful and a touch macabre, the nine short stories take readers into worlds with elements of reality but also supply a fantastic twist. The opening story, &#x201c;The Wrong Grave,&#x201d; plays into the current trend of books featuring the dead and the undead; in it, a boy whose girlfriend dies wants to dig her up to retrieve the poems he put in her coffin. &#x201c;Magic for Beginners&#x201d; centers on a boy whose closest friendships form around a TV show with a loyal following but no set broadcast time or channel. Erudite, economical word choices give readers a strong sense of setting without drowning them in adjectives. The humor is dry and the characters are easy to relate to, even in alien (literally and figuratively) settings. Fantasy readers used to long, single tomes may hesitate at the short-story format, but once they see these, they will want more."&#x2013;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b>, starred review</p><p>"Link, who has two breathlessly received books of strange, surrealistic tales for adults under her belt, makes the leap into the YA fold with this collection of short stories (most previously published in separate anthologies) that tug at the seams of reality, sometimes gently, sometimes violently. In nearly every one of these startlingly, sometimes confoundingly original stories, Link defies expectations with such terrific turnarounds that you are left precipitously wondering not only &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen now?&#x201d; but also &#x201c;Wait, what just happened?&#x201d; Her conception of fantasy is so unique that when she uses words like ghost or magic, they mean something very different than they do anywhere else. Perhaps most surprisingly&#x2014;and memorably&#x2014; is Link&#x2019;s dedicated deadpan delivery that drives home how funny she can be, no matter how dark the material gets. After gobbling up a group of campers, a monster with a self-proclaimed sense of humor bargains with the terrified lone survivor, &#x201c;How about if I only eat you if you say the number that I&#x2019;m thinking of? I promise I won&#x2019;t cheat. I probably won&#x2019;t cheat.&#x201d; Shaun Tan contributes a handful of small illustrations that are, of course, just plain delightful."&#x2013;<b><i>Booklist</i></b>, starred review</p><p>"In her first collection of stories for young adults, Link upends traditional horror, science fiction, and fantasy motifs, creating original, quirky, and distinctly beautiful literary landscapes. Honed, brilliant language renders blood, werewolves, ghosts, magic, and monsters sublime&#x2013;at times even funny. Readers will relish uncertainty in these savory, strange stories and never feel quite sure of their footing. They proceed giddily, jumping from one uncanny premise, phrase, or image to the next, eventually stumbling upon a revelation that hits them like the snap of a rubber band. Clever resolutions and tricky plots place teens on delightfully circuitous reading paths. Unexpected endings force them to double back and reconsider each story from the beginning. In this second read, young adults might notice Link&#x2019;s seamless incorporation of their own experiences. Awkward adolescence, uncomfortable first love, frustrating parents, and complicated friendships surface quietly amid wonderfully knotty, twisted plots and incandescent imagery. This compilation of intricate, transfixing selections succeeds in making the weird wonderful and the grotesque absolutely gorgeous."&#x2013;<i><b>School Library Journal</b></i></p><p></p></p><h2>Adoremus Hymnal: Pew Edition</h2><p>This is the much anticipated new hymnal that will inspire Catholics to want to sing the great sacred music of our heritage.

Over the years their numbers have grown. And now, needing more room, the colony sends scouts into theunknown land beyond. But by venturing forward, the apes are encroaching upon hostile ground -- where creatures dwell that can rip an adult simian to pieces in less than an instant; monstrous reptilians whose incredible savagery isequaled only by their awesome brainpower. To venture into their midst is almost certain doom -- but to remain behind would be suicide. Because another foe is lurking in the shadows: the enemy called Man.

The salon has suffered some unfortunate events, including mistakenly using face creams that burn the skin. Could someone be trying to put them out of business? Meanwhile on the home front, successful career woman Mma Makutsi is going to have a baby. But in Botswana--a land where family has always been held above all else but which is on the crossroads between old and new--this may be cause for as much controversy as celebration.</p></p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is the author of the international phenomenon The No. 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie Series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series, and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served with many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics. He was born in what is now known as Zimbabwe, and he was a law professor at the University of Botswana.There had been no further debate on the issue, and Mma Ramotswe had learned to steer clear of certain topics&#x2014;such as that one&#x2014;that could be guaranteed to elicit an extreme response from her somewhat prickly assistant. Mma Makutsi had many merits, she came to realise, and these easily outweighed her occasional faults. And now, with Mma Makutsi on maternity leave and the office seeming strangely quiet as a result, there was something else that she came to realise: she missed her assistant in a way and to a degree that she had never anticipated. She missed her occasional outbursts; she missed her comments on what was in the newspapers; she even missed the way in which she would intervene in the conversation Mma Ramotswe was having with clients, dropping in observations from her position to the rear and making them stop and turn their heads to reply to somebody over their shoulder&#x2014;not an easy thing to do. All of that she missed, just as she missed Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s knack of putting her teacup down on the desk in a manner that so completely revealed her thinking on the subject under discussion. There was nobody else she knew who could put a cup down on a desk to quite the same effect. It was, she decided, one of the many respects in which Mma Makutsi was&#x2014;and here she could think of only one word to express it&#x2014;irreplaceable. There simply could never be another Mma Makutsi. There could never be another woman from Bobonong, of all places, with flashing round glasses and ninety-seven per cent in the final examinations of the Botswana Secretarial College. There could never be another person who was even remotely capable of standing up to somebody like Mma Potokwane, or putting Charlie in his place when, with all the confidence and ignorance of the young male, he made some outrageous comment. If Mma Makutsi decided not to return from maternity leave then Mma Ramotswe thought that the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency would never be the same again, and might not be worth continuing with.<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked about her. She had worked as a detective for some years now, and in that time she had done her best for her clients. She liked to think that she had made a difference to the lives of at least some people and helped them to deal with problems that had become too burdensome for them to handle on their own. Now, however, surveying the shabby little office, she wondered whether she really had achieved very much. It was a rare moment of gloom, and it was at this point that she realised she was doing something that she very seldom did. She supported many people in their tears&#x2014;for tears could so easily come to those who were recounting their troubles&#x2014;but there were few occasions on which she herself cried. If you are there to staunch the tears of the world, then it does not cross your mind that you yourself may weep. But now she did, not copiously but discreetly and inconsequentially, and barely noticeably&#x2014;except to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who chose that moment to come into the room, wiping the grease off his hands, ready with a remark about what he had just discovered under the latest unfortunate car.<br>&nbsp;<br>For a moment he stood quite still. Then, letting the lint fall from his hands, he swiftly crossed the room and put his arm about his wife&#x2019;s shoulder, lowering his head so that they were cheek to cheek and she could feel the stubble on his chin and the warmth of his breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My Precious, my Precious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She reached up and took his hand. There was still a smear on it&#x2014;some vital fl uid of the injured car to which he had been attending&#x2014;but she paid no attention to that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There is really no reason for me to cry. I am being silly.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You are not silly, Mma. You are never silly. What is it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>With her free hand she took the handkerchief from where it was tucked into the front of her dress. She blew her nose, and with some determination too. After all, the blowing of a nose can be the punctuation that brings such moments to an end.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am much better now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have been sitting and thinking when I should be working. And without Mma Makutsi to talk to, well, you know how hard it can be to sit with the problems of other people.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He knew, or thought he knew. Yes, he knew how she felt. &#x201c;Just like cars,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You sit and look at a car and you think of all its problems, and it can get you down.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m sure it can.&#x201d; She smiled at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be all right, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Mma Makutsi will come back and everything will be the same again.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He removed his hand from her shoulder and stood up. &#x201c;I will make you tea,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked at him with fondness. For some reason, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni did not make very good tea. It was something to do with the quantities of tea he put in the pot, or with not allowing the water to boil properly, or with the way he poured it. For whatever reason, his tea was never quite of the standard achieved by her or by Mma Makutsi. So she thanked him and said that it would be good for her to do something instead of sitting at her desk and moping, and then she made the tea for herself and for her husband, and for Charlie and Fanwell too, and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni took his cup back into the garage where he sipped at it thoughtfully while he decided what to do.</p><h2>Generation XL: Raising Healthy, Intelligent Kids in a High-tech, Junk-food World</h2><p>A detailed guide to giving children a vibrant, successful future and a healthy, wholesome, invigorating youth teaches parents about the importance of good nutrition and the profound effects that inactivity, addiction to media, and super-sized and sugar-laden diets can have on their children.</p><p><p><strong>Dr. Joseph Mercola</strong> is trained as a family physician but now focuses exclusively on natural medicine education.

She established the first British-Palestinian medical charity in 1972 and was an Associate Fellow at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. Her previous books include <i>The Ethnic Health Factfile</i> and <i>Jerusalem Today: What Future for the Peace Process?</i> and, as co-editor with E. Cotran, <i>The Palestinian Exodus, 1948&#x2013;1998.</i>Karmi, a doctor and founding member of the British political group Palestine Action, relates her quest for cultural identity after her "fragile... and misfit Arab family" leaves Jerusalem for England during the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Ironically, they resettle in a Jewish neighborhood in London; Karmi, aged nine, quickly begins to assimilate-becoming an avid reader of English literature and befriending Jewish neighbors-despite her mother's insistence on traditional Palestinian culinary customs, dating mores and family codes. Over the next two decades, events in the Middle East make their non-Arab neighbors increasingly hostile and her Jewish friends' pro-Israel fervor grows; after the Palestinian terrorist hijackings of the 1970s, some acquaintances refuse to speak to her. Karmi becomes an impassioned pro-Palestinian activist, and in 1977 she begins practicing medicine in a Palestinian refugee camp in South Lebanon-and finds that her Western upbringing and habits make her even less welcome there than she was in England. Karmi writes engagingly, weaving Palestinian political and social history through her personal recollections and giving the age-old emigr&#x201a; dilemmas a timely twist.

Although this is a historical novel, set in the last splendid days of Henri II of France, it does in fact reflect the manners and morals of the court of Louix XIV: and in this artificial setting of gossip, deceit and intrigue (ably fostered by the teenage Mary, Queen of Scots), the tortures passions of the gallant Duc de Nemours and the radiant wife of the Prince de Cleves shine out with a pure brilliance.</p><p></p><h2>In His Own Voice: Dramatic &amp; Other Uncollected Works</h2><p>Paul Laurence Dunbar, introduced to the American public by William Dean Howells, was the first native-born African American poet to achieve national and international fame. While there have been many valuable editions of his works over time, gaps have developed when manuscripts were lost or access to uncollected works became difficult.<br><br><i>In His Own Voice</i> brings together previously upublished and uncollected short stories, essays, and poems. This volume also establishes Dunbar's reputation as a dramatist who mastered standard English conventions and used dialect in musical comedy for ironic effects.<br><br><i>In His Own Voice</i> collects more than seventy-five works in six genres. Featured are the previously unpublished play Herrick and two one-act plays, largely ignored for a century, that demonstrate Dunbar's subversion of the minstrel tradition. This generous expansion of the canon also includes a short story never before published.<br><br>Herbert Woodward Martin, renowned for his live portrayal of Dunbar, and Ronald Primeau provide a literary and historical context for this previously untreated material, firmly securing the reputation of an important American voice.</p><p>Herbert Woodward Martin, poet in residence at the University of Dayton and Laureate Poet for Dayton, Ohio, is the author of six books of poetry, two opera libretti, and the text for a new Magnificat. He has given readings of Dunbar's poetry around the world for the past twenty years.<br><br>Ronald Primeau is a professor of English at Central Michigan University. He is the author of books on Paul Laurence Dunbar, Herbert Woodward Martin, Edgar Lee Masters, and the literature of the American highway.Because of his use of black southern dialect and the embarrassment it has engendered among black intellectuals since the Harlem Renaissance, Dunbar--the most famous black poet of his time--has never enjoyed the modern popularity of other black poets. This collection, which includes many works never before published, shows the breadth and depth of his talent and his subtle genius for using dialect and other cultural signifiers to show the hypocrisy of white society and, despite the restrictions imposed by racism, the creativity of African Americans. Dunbar produced a prodigious body of work, including plays, essays, poems, short stories, and songs. He attempted to avoid the minstrel style favored by whites while retaining the authenticity of black southern life. The collection of 76 works is divided into sections on dramatic pieces, essays, short stories, and poems, each preceded by an introduction that places Dunbar and his work in historical and artistic contexts. The collection adds to Dunbar's reputation as an important forerunner of black American poetry. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Readers already know Gray as an award-winning biographer, a writer who has brilliantly captured significant individuals and dramatic moments in our history. Now, in <i>The Promise of Canada</i>, she weaves together masterful portraits of nine influential Canadians, creating a unique history of the country over the past 150 years.<br> <br>What do these people&#x2014;from George-�tienne Cartier and Emily Carr to Tommy Douglas, Margaret Atwood, and Elijah Harper&#x2014;have in common? Each, according to Charlotte Gray, has left an indelible mark on our country. Deliberately avoiding a &#x201c;top down&#x201d; approach to our history, Gray has chosen people whose ideas have caught her imagination, ideas that over time have become part of our collective conversation. She also highlights many other Canadians, past and present, who have added to the ongoing debate over how we see ourselves, arguing that Canada has constantly reimagined itself in every generation since 1867.<br> <br>Beautifully illustrated with evocative black and white images and colourful artistic visions of our country, <i>The Promise of Canada</i> is a fresh take on our history that offers fascinating insights into how we have matured and yet how&#x2014;150 years after Confederation and beyond&#x2014;we are still a people in progress.

I view the diversity of races in British North America in this way: we are of different races, not for the purpose of warring against each other, but in order to compete and emulate for the general good.<br> <br>&#x2014;George-�tienne Cartier, Confederation Debates (1865)<br> <br>Everyone acknowledges that Canadian Confederation has been a great success, and those who had the greatest doubts about the venture are now ready to confess that the plan was a wise one.<br> <br>&#x2014;Globe (Dominion Day, 1877)<br> <br><br> <br>Let&#x2019;s start with one of the most famous images in Canadian history: the photograph taken in September 1864 of the Fathers of Confederation on the steps of the lieutenant-governor&#x2019;s mansion in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.<br> <br>If I didn&#x2019;t know what this old-fashioned picture recorded, I&#x2019;d give it barely a glance. Our public institutions are full of similar compositions&#x2014;a bunch of men standing in front of a sturdy classical building. They could be school trustees or railway engineers. It is an excruciatingly exclusive image: a blur of white-haired, bearded patriarchy, with not a woman, non-white person, or Indigenous Canadian in sight. That was official Canada 150 years ago.<br> <br>But I do know that this particular photo records a momentous event. Those men had just invented a new country called the Dominion of Canada. There were still plenty of details to work out, and it would be another thirty months before the British North America Act would be signed on the other side of the Atlantic. Yet these twenty-three sombrely clad lawyers, farmers, and merchants, from five British colonies, had listened carefully to each other and reached consensus. No wonder they decided it called for a commemorative picture. Today, there would be lights, video cameras, and reporters on the spot. Back then, in the cozy little island capital, there was one local photographer with a cumbersome camera that laboriously captured images on glass plates.<br> <br>When I look more closely, I see interesting dynamics in this image. Most of those posed on the porch&#x2014;provincial premiers, cabinet members, opposition leaders&#x2014;radiate the self-assurance of powerful men. However, at least a third of them are looking not at the camera but at the figure who is dead centre in the group: John A. Macdonald, who had just used his extraordinary negotiating skills to broker an agreement. The man who would now become the first prime minister of post-Confederation Canada draws all attention to himself as he sprawls on the steps in the nonchalant pose of a matinee idol. Very clever, John A.<br> <br>However, my eye is also caught by another figure, standing to Macdonald&#x2019;s right and sporting a stylish tailcoat, a well-groomed shock of white hair, and an air of private triumph. This is George-�tienne Cartier. &#x201c;As bold as a lion&#x201d; is how Macdonald himself described his elegant French-Canadian colleague. Macdonald even admitted, &#x201c;But for him Confederation could not have been carried.&#x201d;1 Without question, John A. Macdonald had the original vision that a country like Canada could exist. But it was the brains and quiet persistence of George-�tienne Cartier that turned the vision into reality.<br><br> <br>Astute and elegant, George-�tienne Cartier ensured that French-Canadian interests would be protected within the new Dominion.<br><br>George-�tienne Cartier, a shrewd Montreal lawyer, is the man we have to thank for making Canada a federation. Unlike the &#x201c;Mother Country,&#x201d; as his contemporaries called Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada would not be a unitary state with one central government. Instead, the new Dominion would be designed with two levels of government: a federal government in Ottawa, to handle matters that affected the whole federation (relations with Westminster, interprovincial railways, and trade), and a more local government in each province that joined up. Unlike British counties, French d�partements, or even American states in the late nineteenth century, Canadian provinces would have an extraordinary degree of control over their own affairs. By pushing such a federal system, Cartier ensured that Quebec would join the Dominion. French-speaking Canadians living in the new province of Quebec were reassured that they would run everything that was essential to the survival of their culture. His major challenge was to find the right partner to help him achieve his goal. He found such a partner in Macdonald, the charismatic lawyer from Kingston, Ontario. At Charlottetown, Cartier&#x2019;s idea was the most crucial component of Macdonald&#x2019;s vision.<br> <br>One hundred and fifty years later, the federal system that Cartier envisaged is the basic building block of Canada&#x2019;s uniqueness. It is Cartier that we can thank for developing the government structure that in our country&#x2019;s early years allowed two very different groups of immigrants&#x2014;the French who had started settling the St. Lawrence Valley three centuries earlier, and successive waves of British who had scattered elsewhere, particularly after the mid-eighteenth century&#x2014;to live alongside each other. That same federal structure has helped Canada absorb endless new stresses: dramatic expansion across the continent, a troubled relationship with Indigenous peoples, demands from regions that felt ignored, shifting economic patterns, surges of immigrants from every corner of the globe.<br> <br>In any discussion of what has shaped the character of our country&#x2014;not just the structure of Canadian government, but the pluralism and tolerance for difference that are still hallmarks of Canada&#x2014;Cartier&#x2019;s contribution forms the bedrock. That is why I decided that his vision for Canada should kick off my exploration of this country&#x2019;s enduring potential.<br> <br>Over the course of the past century and a half, Cartier&#x2019;s reputation has been overshadowed by that of John A. Macdonald, &#x201c;the man who made us,&#x201d; according to Macdonald&#x2019;s biographer Richard Gwyn. When Cartier is remembered at all, it is as Macdonald&#x2019;s sidekick. In my hometown, Ottawa, we have the Macdonald-Cartier International Airport and the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge. In George-�tienne Cartier&#x2019;s own province of Quebec, nationalists have tried to eradicate him from collective memory. But if he shaped Canada, what shaped George-�tienne Cartier? Who was this enigmatic figure in the Confederation photograph, who started his adult life as a rebel and ended it as a British baronet with a valet, a country estate, and a coat of arms?<br> <br><br> <br>Quebec&#x2019;s Richelieu River is modest compared with the great rivers flowing through the Canadian landscape, such as the St. Lawrence, the Fraser, and the Mackenzie. The Richelieu, rarely more than half a kilometre wide and not particularly deep or fast-flowing, reminds me of a European waterway, with oaks and weeping willows along its banks and plenty of evidence of human habitation. These days, heavy traffic flows in and out of nearby Montreal along autoroutes, leaving the river to pleasure boats and fishing enthusiasts. From the water, I glimpse the silver steeples of churches and houses with the steeply sloping roofs that characterize Quebec rural architecture. Behind them stretch fields planted with corn and soybeans.<br> <br>George-�tienne Cartier was born on the fertile banks of this river on September 6, 1814, in the village of Saint-Antoine-sur-Richelieu. Today, a bronze bust of him stands here on a granite plinth, surrounded by red impatiens flowers; the inscription reads, &#x201c;Cartier: Son Village Natale, La Patrie Reconnaissante.&#x201d; The bust features mutton chop whiskers and a truculent expression&#x2014;every inch a senior statesman. But when he was growing up here, the community knew him first as a rambunctious little boy, and then as a young man with attitude. Only his family&#x2019;s status protected him from several cuffs on the ear.<br> <br>George-�tienne was the seventh of eight children of a grain merchant, who claimed (on scant evidence) that he was a descendant of the Jacques Cartier, the great French navigator who in 1534 became the first European to map the Gulf of St. Lawrence. George-�tienne&#x2019;s family was probably not quite so venerable, but it undoubtedly had deep roots in North American soil: his great-grandfather, Jacques Cartier I, left Europe for Quebec City, New France&#x2019;s most important city, in 1735. The Cartiers built up a lucrative grain business, then moved it closer to the rapidly expanding commercial city of Montreal. Their life in the bucolic Richelieu Valley was comfortable and privileged. Compared with most of their Saint-Antoine neighbours&#x2014;farmers and tradespeople&#x2014;the Cartiers were important and worldly. They lived like country squires in a large stone house, and when guests arrived, the brandy flowed and the tables groaned. Youngsters raised in such comfortable circumstances acquire a sense of entitlement.<br><br> <br>Known as the House of the Seven Chimneys, the Cartier mansion was a landmark for boatmen on the nearby Richelieu River and had its own private wharf.<br><br>But George-�tienne would also have been aware of the battle-scarred history of his region. Originating in Lake Champlain and flowing north into the St. Lawrence River, the Richelieu River had been an important trade route for centuries. Before Europeans arrived, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), Wyandot (Huron), and Algonquin peoples regularly paddled along its length. Because the river teemed with bass, sturgeon, and pike, they named it Masoliantekw, which means &#x201c;water where there is plenty of food&#x201d; in the local Abenaki tongue. Once French and English traders showed their faces, it also brimmed with conflict. The river&#x2019;s strategic position between New France and New England meant that it was frequently the site of murderous clashes between French and Haudenosaunee, and French and English. The scuffles subsided only after the 1759 defeat by the British of the Canadiens (as inhabitants of New France were known) on the Plains of Abraham.<br> <br>When George-�tienne and his brothers paddled upriver, they saw the ruins of several forts, both French and English, scattered among the willow trees and prosperous farming communities. However, they rarely caught sight of the region&#x2019;s Indigenous inhabitants. Depleted by disease and hunger, most had retreated west. Local Mohawks kept to themselves in their communities at Kanesatake, on the Ottawa River, and Kahnawake, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence opposite Montreal.<br> <br>For the small boy, the solid stone house in Saint-Antoine-sur-Richelieu and his extensive network of uncles and cousins were his whole world. There were plenty of diversions for a wealthy family like the Cartiers&#x2014;dances and balls in each other&#x2019;s mansions, contacts with fellow merchants in Boston and New England. However, Lower Canada (as Quebec was then known) was a small enclave in a larger backwater far from any power centres. In the year of his birth, the combined population (not including Indigenous people) of all the British colonies on the North American mainland was only about five hundred thousand, of whom perhaps three hundred thousand were French-speaking. Unlike the Cartiers, most colonists spent their days tilling the land, logging the forests, fishing the rivers and oceans, or shipping furs, grain, and logs; Montreal, which was now the largest city in British North America, had only twenty thousand residents. Compared with the booming republic to the south, with eight million citizens and big ambitions, British North America was poor, backward, and isolated. Only Halifax in Nova Scotia, with its British military base, and Quebec City, with its wealthy Roman Catholic seminaries and cathedral-basilica, offered any competition to cities like Boston or Philadelphia.<br> <br>Nevertheless, Lower Canada was rich in tradition: as well as a larger population, it boasted more history and culture, and a higher birth rate, than any of the other impoverished British colonies&#x2014;Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Upper Canada (today&#x2019;s Ontario). George-�tienne&#x2019;s father, Jacques Cartier III, filled his son with pride in his people. Although he named the son born in 1814 George after the reigning British monarch, King George III (on the birth certificate, the name is spelled in the French style, Georges), he loved to belt out voyageur paddle songs and point to the sturdy survival of Lower Canada&#x2019;s habitants. And there was no shortage of village elders who reminisced about the old days, when their region was part of New France, owing allegiance to Paris and enjoying wine exported from French ports such as Le Havre and La Rochelle.<br> <br>To a small boy, the rhythms of Canadien rural life must have seemed timeless. However, dramatic changes lay just over the horizon. Imperial power brokers in Westminster were losing interest in British North America. In their view, the North American colony was important only as a source of masts for the Royal Navy and as a dumping ground for demobilized soldiers and destitute Irish peasants. As the costs of maintaining troops and separate colonial governments in each colony rose, enthusiasm for these distant, frozen lands fell.<br> <br>When he was ten years old, Cartier&#x2019;s life changed abruptly: he was shipped off to the care of the most powerful institution in Lower Canada, the Roman Catholic Church. He was too young to recognize it at the time, but his political indoctrination had begun.<br> <br>George-�tienne and his brother Damien were enrolled at the Coll�ge de Montr�al, run by the Sulpician Fathers, the dominant religious order in Quebec after the Jesuits were expelled in 1762. The college was the pre-eminent seat of learning for French-speaking boys in Lower Canada. Although it has changed dramatically since George-�tienne entered its doors, it is still considered one of the best high schools in Montreal. The two Cartier youngsters would spend the next six years within the college&#x2019;s forbidding stone walls and tightly disciplined routines. Their teachers, all born and trained in France, gave them a superb classical education in language, science, religion, and music. The college bridged the two solitudes of Quebec society, since it catered to the sons of the English-speaking as well as French-speaking merchant class. As a result, Cartier emerged from his years there with a strong sense of linguistic duality as well as a sturdy old boys&#x2019; network. He also absorbed a firm commitment to the idea of &#x201c;survivance de la race&#x201d;: the Canadiens must fight to protect their language, their culture, and their church. They must resist any attempt to drown them in a sea of Protestant English. That lesson became the lodestar of George-�tienne&#x2019;s approach to public life. It would, in turn, shape the country that we live in today.<br> <br>After graduating from the college, what next? For the fifth son of a good Canadien family, there was only one course: the law. In 1831, just before his seventeenth birthday, Cartier began studying for the bar in Montreal with �douard-�tienne Rodier; he would be called to the bar four years later. Rodier was another Coll�ge de Montr�al graduate who was already a member of the Legislative Assembly in Quebec City, the capital of Lower Canada. Cartier also found a niche within...</p><h2>Final Notes (Nancy Drew Files, No 65)</h2><p>While touring the mansion of deceased country singer Curtis Taylor, Nancy discovers a tape the star made the night he died--a tape that could prove that he was murdered</p><p></p><h2>The Thousand Autumns Of Jacob De Zoet (Thorndike Press Large Print Reviewers&#39; Choice)</h2><p>Dispatched to the influential Japanese port of Dejima in 1799, ambitious clerk Jacob de Zoet resolves to earn enough money to deserve his wealthy fianc�ee, an effort that is challenged by his relationship with the midwife daughter of a samurai.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2010</strong>: David Mitchell reinvents himself with each book, and it's thrilling to watch. His novels like <em>Ghostwritten</em> and <em>Cloud Atlas</em> spill over with narrators and language, collecting storylines connected more in spirit than in fact. In <em>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</em>, he harnesses that plenitude into a more traditional form, a historical novel set in Japan at the turn into the 19th century, when the island nation was almost entirely cut off from the West except for a tiny, quarantined Dutch outpost. Jacob is a pious but not unappealing prig from Zeeland, whose self-driven duty to blurt the truth in a corrupt and deceitful trading culture, along with his headlong love for a local midwife, provides the early engine for the story, which is confined at first to the Dutch enclave but crosses before long to the mainland. Every page is overfull with language, events, and characters, exuberantly saturated in the details of the time and the place but told from a knowing and undeniably modern perspective. It's a story that seems to contain a thousand worlds in one. <em>--Tom Nissley</em>David Mitchell</p><h2>Physics Lab Experiments, Custom Publication</h2><p>a few excercise pages were torn out of the book but over all is new never used</p><p></p><h2>Marilyn Monroe: Private and Undisclosed (Brief Histories (Paperback))</h2><p>Following a series of sensationalist biographies of Marilyn Monroe in recent years, this comprehensive, meticulously researched volume brings an important fresh perspective to the many controversies in her life, serving as an essential sourcebook of documentary and photographic evidence.</p><p>Michelle Morgan is the founder and President of the UK fan club, the Marilyn Lives Society, established in 1991.

He's copulating with more mature ladies, and nausea has replaced the dulcet chest chimes that used to alert him to genuine art treasures. At least this adventure (following The Sin Within Her Smile) brings him back to East Anglia, ever his optimum setting. Things turn truly sour for Lovejoy when his friend Tryer, proprietor of a mobile sex museum, is murdered. As he investigates, Lovejoy tries to understand the strange decline of the village of Fenstone (formerly Middle Snorting) and to cope with a gaggle of forgettable American tourists and their British cohorts. The older women of the title have considerable charm-"'Courage, Philadora,' she said quietly. 'Lovejoy doesn't want weak-willed vicarage ladies. He needs partners of mettle.'" Interesting asides abound: discussions of "tomorrow auctions" and penis rings, startling disclosures about Bonnie Prince Charlie and John F. Kennedy and Lovejoy's preparations for his big exhibition of fakes and forgeries. The motive for all the mayhem is ludicrously limp, but the denouement is quite delightful. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.That old reprobate Lovejoy--randy, irreverent, and lovable--is back in yet another delightful romp. After 16 Lovejoy books, Gash has the formula for success down pat, but he's never repetitive--each story is more outrageously fun and funny than the last. In this outing, Lovejoy not only appreciates "the grace and charm in older women" of the title, but if truth be told, he waxes rhapsodic about <i>all</i> women. The two Misses Dewhurst, tearoom proprietors and refined spinsters with a zodiacal bent, inform Lovejoy that he's now "on their team" since his Obverse Zodiac sign is a perfect match with theirs. While poor, puzzled Lovejoy is still trying to make sense of this perplexing proposal, his old friend Tryer, owner of the mobile Sex Museum, is found murdered; Lovejoy is relentlessly pursued by the mysterious Miss Juliana Witherspoon; and his pals want his help with another creative heist. Somehow, all these diverse roads seem to lead Lovejoy to the mysteriously dying town of Middle Snoring. As usual, Lovejoy's adventures, whether in print or on the popular cable television series, evoke giggles, guffaws, and belly laughs; the breadth of his antiques knowledge evokes awe; and his "divvying" skills and creative scams elicit jealous admiration.

Parker and Sue Grafton: Author One-on-One</strong><br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together blockbuster authors Robert B. Parker and Sue Grafton and asked them to interview each other.</p> <p>Robert B. Parker&#x2019;s wise-cracking, street-smart Boston private-eye Spenser earned him a devoted following and wide critical acclaim. Before his death in January 2010, Parker also wrote the bestselling Jesse Stone novels and a new series of Westerns featuring two guns-for-hire, Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch. Read on to see Robert B. Parker's questions for Sue Grafton, or turn the tables to see what Grafton asked Parker.</p> <strong>Parker</strong>: Tell me about you and Kinsey Millhone and the connection between you.<br> <p><strong>Grafton</strong>: Kinsey Millhone is my alter ego, the woman I might have been had I not married young and had children. She's younger, thinner, and braver than I, but a good companion nonetheless. Since she can know only what I know, I've taken classes in criminal law and self-defense. I've studied police procedure, private eye procedure, toxicology, ballistics, and crime scene investigation. Beyond that, the prime agreement between us is that I don't tell her, she tells me. When readers ask what she&#x2019;ll be doing after <em>Z is for Zero</em>, I assure them I haven't the faintest idea. <br></p> <p><strong>Parker</strong>: Describe your writing process (e.g., I get up in the morning, have a martini to get my heart going...).<br><br> <strong>Grafton</strong>: I take a 5.4-mile walk five days a week, so my writing schedule is often dictated by the weather. If it's too hot or too cold, I walk first thing in the morning, come home, shower, dress, and reach my desk at 9:45 or so. I work until lunch, when I take a short break, returning to my desk until mid-to-late afternoon. If I haven't done a morning walk, I walk when my work is done. <em>Then</em> I drink. <br><strong><br>Parker</strong>: You've spent time in Hollywood. Tell me about that.<strong><br><br>Grafton</strong>: I refer to that period of my life as "doing one to fifteen in Hollywood." I loved it at first, as dazzled as anyone who hasn't figured out yet how treacherous life there can be. As I've said on previous occasions, I learned two things about myself in Hollywood: one, I'm not a team player; and two, I'm not a good sport. The producers I met were well-educated and articulate, and usually offered me a cup of coffee before they set in to savaging my work. I got too old and cranky to put up with that, so I invented Kinsey Millhone as my way out. I liken it to digging my way out of prison with a teaspoon.<strong><br><br>Parker</strong>: Do you read reviews? Pay attention to them? Find them helpful? Have an opinion on them?<br><strong><br>Grafton</strong>: Where possible, I avoid reviews. The good ones only encourage swell-headedness and the bad ones hurt my feelings or infuriate me. In either case, by the time reviews appear, the book is written and out on the stands. What's a poor girl to do? There's no point in subjecting myself to the reactions of readers and reviewers, since their response is nothing I can control.<br><strong><br>Parker</strong>: People sometimes ask me why I write what I write, and I answer, "Because that's what I know how to do."

Most recently, she was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.</p><h2>The Sun is Not Merciful: Short Stories</h2><p>A collection of stories about contemporary tribal life.</p><p>Recipient of two literary prizes (the Virginia McCormick Scully Award and the 1985 American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation) The Sun Is Not Merciful is Pawnee/ Otoe writer Anna Lee Walter's first collection of short fiction. In each of these eight stories contemporary American Indians are constrained or distorted by the force field of Anglo culture, and in each story, Native values endure and transcend. Living entirely alone or as solitary couples (husband/ wife, grandmother/ granddaughter, sister/sister, mother/ daughter) characters move doggedly toward their individual visions of beauty and harmony. An old uncle, degenerated into alcholism and vagrancy, entrusts his vision of beauty to his neices, who are able to carry on. An epileptic pariah and his loving housemaid-turned-wife cultivate a nurturing silence until death interrupts; dogs agitated at graveside save the accidentally buried old man so that he can instruct: "There is no death. There is only a change of worlds." A mother, unable to save her daughter from the advances of an Anglo child molester, retreats with her child into solitude and denial, the only mechanisms cffective against the White Man. For all their geographical isolation the characters are part of a powerful tribal matrix, and acquire their punishments and rewards from it. Anglo religion, multidenominational and hierarchical, is powerless to save Lena's granddaughter from the devil, but tribal unity and belief protect the girl. Sonny breaks Anglo law and tribal law but only tribal law has real meaning; it has the power not only to punish but to forgive. And two old women, poaching fish on their family's land turned now into a recreation/ hydroelectric project, break Anglo law in order to keep their own. Epitomizing nonviolent resistance, they are quite aware that the white park ranger has none of the power he thinks he has to punish or forgive. Presumably, neither does any AngJo. Although this collection offers characters, plots, scenes, and image patterns consistent with European narrative tradition, it holds back on the urge to make the White Man understand the Indian at any cost. It permits a view, but no particular entry. Free of polemics, it finally dazzles by aloof austerity. "Don't fight the sun," says one old man. "It's going to whip you down if you fight it. Let it be. " -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>The eight simple, moving tales collected here portray contemporary Native American life. The stark reality of a contemporary insular society is skillfully blended with the centuries-old culture that is a backdrop for the stories told by Walters's memorable people. "The Resurrection of John Stink" tells of an apparently epileptic man who's tended by 19-year-old Effie, who falls in love with him. After a seizure, John Stink stops breathing, and the white doctor Effie's fetched declares him dead. But when he's buried in a mound, his dogs won't leave him, so Effie digs him outaliveand he lives to be a very old man. At times, the narrative tends towards self-consciousness in its replication of a rich oral tradition, but this is a clear ethnic voice that deserves a wide audience. Ann H.

She introduced such beloved characters as Jinnicky the Red Jinn, Sir Hokus, Speedy, Terrybubble, and best-loved of all, Kabumpo, the elegant elephant. Thompson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 27, 1891. She had two sisters, Dorothy and Janet, and one brother, Richard. When Thompson was two years old her father became night editor of The New York Times and the family moved to Brooklyn, New York. Her father died suddenly in 1895 and Thompson&#39;s mother returned to Philadelphia with the four young children. In 1914 Thompson began writing an elaborate children&#39;s page for the Philadelphia Public Ledger. The weekly page contained poems, stories, fables, helpful columns about pets, dolls, toys, and much more. Her first book, THE PERHAPPSEY CHAPS (1918) was a collection of fairy poems from the Public Ledger, and a similar volume of fairy tales, THE PRINCESS OF COZYTOWN, was published in 1922. In 1920 Thompson was contracted by the Reilly and Lee Company to continue the Oz series after L. Frank Baum&#39;s death in 1919. Her first Oz book, THE ROYAL BOOK OF OZ (1921), was credited to Baum with the additional byline &#34;Enlarged and edited by Ruth Plumly Thompson.&#34; But the book was solely the work of Thompson. In 1921, she gave up her job at the Public Ledger and devoted herself to writing an Oz book each year until 1939. Reilly and Lee also published an omnibus volume of Thompson&#39;s Ledger material called THE WONDER BOOK (1929). From the mid-1930s to mid-1940s Thompson worked as editor of the David McKay Company&#39;s King Comics, providing an editorial page and short story for almost every issue. She wrote editorials for Ace Comics and Magic Comics, too. David McKay also published Thompson&#39;s KING KOJO (1936), originally serialized in the pages of King Comics. In the 1940s and &#39;50s Thompson sold many stories to Jack and Jill magazine and she wrote Jack and Jill&#39;s &#34;Perky Puppet&#34; page until Decem</p><h2>Ask Me If I&#39;m Happy</h2><p>&#39;Ask Me If I&#39;m Happy&#39; is a wonderfully funny and colourful memoir from one of our best-loved television actors, Peter Bowles.</p><p>One of Britain&#39;s best-known and best-loved actors, Peter Bowles has starred in many West End theatre hits and enjoys worldwide success from television series such as THE IRISH RM and TO THE MANOR BORN, and films such as Antonioni&#39;s BLOWUP and Tony Richardson&#39;s THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, and is currently starring on the London stage in THE RIVALS with Penelope Keith, directed by Sir Peter Hall.&#39;For all Peter Bowles&#39;s many triumphs on screen, it is clear from this book that the stage is where his heart is.

With their trio of ragged fighter craft, they run contraband, rob airships and generally make a nuisance of themselves.

He smiled sourly.<br><br>"Just imagine," he said. "Imagine what this feels like going through your head."<br><br>Grayther Crake didn't want to imagine anything of the sort. He was trying not to throw up, having already disgraced himself once that morning. He glanced at the man next to him, hoping for some sign that he had a plan, some way to get them out of this. But Darian Frey's face was hard and showed nothing.<br><br>Both of them had their wrists tied together, backs against the damp and peeling wall. Three armed thugs ensured they stayed there.<br><br>The smuggler's name was Lawsen Macarde. He was squat and grizzled, hair and skin greasy with a sheen of sweat and grime, features squashed across a face that was broad and deeply lined. Crake watched him slide the bullet into the empty drum of his revolver. He snapped it shut, spun it, then turned toward his audience.<br><br>"Do you think it hurts?" he mused. "Even for a moment? Or is it all over-bang!-in a flash?"<br><br>"If you're that curious, try it out on yourself," Frey suggested.<br><br>Macarde hit him in the gut, putting all of his considerable weight behind the punch. Frey doubled over with a grunt and almost went to his knees. He straightened with some effort until he was standing again.<br><br>"Good point," he wheezed. "Well made."<br><br>Macarde pressed the muzzle of the revolver against Crake's forehead and stared at Frey.<br><br>"Count of three. You want to see your man's brains all over the wall?"<br><br>Frey didn't reply. Crake's face was gray beneath his close-cropped blond beard. He stank of alcohol and sweat. His eyes flicked to the captain nervously.<br><br>"One."<br><br>Frey showed no signs of reacting.<br><br>"I'm just a passenger!" Crake said. "I'm not even part of his crew!" His accent betrayed an aristocratic upbringing that wasn't evident from his appearance. His hair was scruffy, his boots vomit-spattered, his greatcoat half unbuttoned and hanging open. He was near soiling himself with fear.<br><br>"You have the ignition code for the Ketty Jay?" Macarde asked him. "You know how to fire her up and get her flying?"<br><br>Crake swallowed and shook his head.<br><br>"Then shut up. Two."<br><br>"Nobody flies the Ketty Jay but me, Macarde. I told you that," Frey said. His eyes flickered restlessly around the storeroom. Cloud- muffled sunlight drifted in through horizontal slits high up on one stone wall, illuminating rough-hewn hemp sacks, coils of rope, wicked- looking hooks that hung on chains from the ceiling. Chill shadows cut deep into the seamed faces of Macarde and his men, and the air smelled of damp and decay.<br><br>"Three," said Macarde, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Crake flinched and whimpered as the hammer fell on an empty chamber. After a moment, it sank in: he was still alive. He let out a shuddering breath as Macarde took the gun away, then cast a hateful glare at Frey.<br><br>Frey's expression was blank. He was a different person from the man Crake had known the night before. That man had laughed as loud as Malvery and made fun of Pinn with the rest of them. He told stories that had them in stitches and drank until he passed out. That man, Crake had known for almost three months. That man, Crake might have called a friend.<br><br>Macarde studied the pistol theatrically. "Five chambers. One down. Think you'll be lucky again?" He put the muzzle back to Crake's forehead.<br><br>"Oh, please, no," Crake begged. "Please, please, no. Frey, tell him. Stop playing around and just tell him."<br><br>"One," said Macarde.<br><br>Crake stared at the now-stranger to his right, his eyes pleading. No doubt about it, it was the same man. There were the same wolfishly handsome features, the same unkempt black hair, the same lean frame beneath his long coat. But the spark in his eyes had gone. There was no sign of the ready, wicked smile that usually lurked at the corner of his mouth.<br><br>He wasn't going to give in.<br><br>"Two."<br><br>"Please," he whispered. But Frey just looked away.<br><br>"Three."<br><br>Macarde paused on the trigger, waiting for a last-moment intervention. It didn't come.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Crake's heart leaped hard enough to hurt. He let out a gasp. His mouth was sticky, his whole body was trembling, and he desperately wanted to be sick again.<br><br>You bastard, he thought. You rot-hearted bastard.<br><br>"Didn't think you had it in you, Frey," Macarde said, with a hint of admiration in his voice. He thrust the revolver back into a holster somewhere amid the motley of battered jackets that he wore. "You'd let him die rather than give up the Ketty Jay? That's cold."<br><br>Frey shrugged. "He's just a passenger." Crake swore at him under his breath.<br><br>Macarde paced around the storeroom while a rat-faced thug covered the prisoners with the point of a cutlass. The other two thugs stood in the shadows: an enormous shaven-headed bruiser and a droop-eyed man wearing a tatty knitted cap. One guarded the only exit, the other lounged against a barrel, idly examining a lever-action shotgun. There were a dozen more like them downstairs.<br><br>Crake clawed at his mind for some way to escape. In spite of the shock and the pounding in his head, he forced himself to be rational. He'd always prided himself on his discipline and self-control, which only made the humiliation of the last few moments harder to bear. He'd pictured himself displaying a little more dignity in the face of his own extinction.<br><br>Their pistols had been taken after they were found at the inn, snoring drunk at the table. Macarde had taken Frey's beautiful cutlass-my cutlass, Crake thought bitterly-for his own. Now it hung tantalizingly from his belt. Crake noticed Frey watching it closely.<br><br>What of Malvery and Pinn? They'd evidently wandered off elsewhere in the night to continue their carousing, leaving their companions to sleep. It was simply bad luck that Macarde had found him and Frey, tonight of all nights. A few more hours and they'd have been out of port and away. Instead, they'd been dragged upstairs-pausing only for Crake to be sick on his own feet-and bundled into this dank storeroom, where an anonymous and squalid death awaited them if Frey didn't give up the ignition codes for his aircraft.<br><br>I could be dead, Crake thought. That son of a bitch didn't do a thing to stop it.<br><br>"Listen," said Macarde to Frey. "Let's be businessmen about this. We go back, you and I. Worked together several times, haven't we? And even though I came to expect a certain sloppiness from you over the years-late delivery, cargo that wasn't quite what you promised, that sort of thing-you never flat-out screwed me. Not 'til now."<br><br>"What do you want me to say, Macarde? It wasn't meant to end up this way."<br><br>"I don't want to kill you, Frey," said Macarde in a tone that suggested the opposite. "I don't even want to kill that milksop little pansy over there. I just want what's mine. You owe me an aircraft. I'll take the Ketty Jay."<br><br>"The Ketty Jay's worth five of yours."<br><br>"Well, consider the difference as the price of me not cutting off your balls and stuffing them in your ears."<br><br>"That's fair," conceded Frey.<br><br>"That aerium you sold me was bad stuff. Admit it."<br><br>"What did you expect for that price?"<br><br>"You told me it came straight from the refinery. What you sold me was so degraded it wouldn't have lifted a biscuit, let alone twenty tons of aircraft."<br><br>"Sales patter. You know how it is."<br><br>"It must have been through the engines of every freebooter from here to the coast!" Macarde growled. "I'd have got better quality stuff siphoning it off the wrecks in a junkyard!"<br><br>Crake gave Frey a fleeting look of guilt. "Actually," grinned Frey, "it'd have been about the same."<br><br>Macarde's punch came blindingly fast, snapping Frey's head back so it cracked against the wall. Frey groaned and put his hands to his face. His fingertips came away bloody from a split lip.<br><br>"Little less attitude will make this all go a lot smoother," Macarde advised.<br><br>"Right," said Frey. "Now you listen. If there's some way I can make this up to you, some job I can do, something I can steal, whatever you want . . . well, that's one thing. But you will never get my craft, you hear? You can stuff whatever you like in my ears. The Ketty Jay is mine."<br><br>"I don't think you're in much of a position to negotiate," Macarde said.<br><br>"Really? 'Cause the way I see it, the Ketty Jay is useless without the ignition code, and the only one who knows it is me. That puts me in a pretty strong position as long as I don't tell you."<br><br>Macarde made a terse gesture toward Droop-Eye. "Cut off his thumbs."<br><br>Droop-Eye left his shotgun atop the barrel he'd been leaning on and drew a dagger.<br><br>"Whoa, wait!" said Frey quickly. "I'm talking compensation. I'm talking giving you more than the value of your craft. You cut off my thumbs and I can't fly. Believe me, you do that and I take the code to my grave."<br><br>"I had five men on that craft," said Macarde, as Droop-Eye came over. "They were pulling up out of a canyon. I saw it. The pilot tried to get the lift and suddenly it just wasn't there. Bad aerium, see? Couldn't clear the lip of the canyon. Tore the belly off, and the rest of it went up in flames. Five men dead. You going to compensate me for them too?"<br><br>"Listen, there's got to be something you want." He motioned suddenly at Crake. "Here, I know! He's got a gold tooth. Solid gold. Show them, Crake."<br><br>Crake stared at the captain in disbelief.<br><br>"I don't want a gold tooth, Frey," said Macarde patiently. "Give me your thumbs."<br><br>"It's a start!" Frey cried. He glared hard and meaningfully at Crake. "Crake, why don't you show them your gold tooth?"<br><br>"Here, let us have a look," Rat said, leaning closer to Crake. "Show us a smile, you little nancy."<br><br>Crake took a deep, steadying breath and gave Rat his most dazzling grin. It was a picture pose he'd perfected in response to a mortifying ferrotype taken by the family photographer. After that, he vowed he'd never be embarrassed by a picture again.<br><br>"Hey! That's not half bad," Rat commented, peering at his reflection in the shiny tooth. And Crake grinned, harder than he'd ever grinned in his life.<br><br>Droop-Eye pulled Frey away from the wall, over to a set of cobwebbed shelves. He swept away a few empty jars with his arm and then forced Frey's bound hands down onto the shelf. Frey had balled his fists and was refusing to extend his thumbs. Droop-Eye hammered him in the kidney, but he still held fast.<br><br>"What I'm saying, Macarde, is that we can both come out ahead," Frey argued through gritted teeth. "We'll work off the debt, me and my crew."<br><br>"You'll be halfway to New Vardia the second I take my eyes off you," Macarde replied.<br><br>"What about collateral? What if I leave you one of the fighters? Pinn has a Skylance; that thing's faster than greased owl shit. You ought to see it go!"<br><br>Droop-Eye drove a knee into his thigh, making him grunt, but Frey still wouldn't extend his thumbs. The thug by the door smirked at his companion's attempts to make Frey cooperate.<br><br>"Here, listen!" Rat shouted. Everyone stopped and turned to look at him, surprised by the volume of his voice. A strange expression crossed his face, as if he was puzzled to find himself the center of attention. Then it disappeared beneath a dawning revelation.<br><br>"Why don't we let them go?" he suggested.<br><br>Macarde gave him a reptilian glare. "What?" he said slowly.<br><br>"No, wait, hear me out," said Rat, with the attitude of one caught up in an idea so brilliant that it would require careful explanation to his benighted audience. "I mean, killing 'em won't do no good to us. They don't look like they've got a shillie to their name anyways. If we let 'em go, they could, you know, spread the good word and stuff: 'That Lawsen Macarde is a reasonable man. The kind of man you can do business with.' "<br><br>Macarde had been steadily reddening as Rat's speech went on, and now his unshaven jowls were trembling with fury. Droop-Eye and Bruiser exchanged wary glances. Neither of them knew what had possessed their companion to pipe up with his opinion, but they both knew the inevitable outcome. Macarde's hand twitched toward the hilt of Frey's cutlass.<br><br>"You should listen to the man," said Crake. "He talks a lot of sense."<br><br>Macarde's murderous gaze switched to Crake. Absurdly, Crake was still smiling. He flashed his toothy grin at Macarde now, looking for all the world like some oily salesman instead of a man facing his imminent demise.<br><br>But then Macarde noticed something. The anger drained from his face and he craned in to look a little closer.<br><br>"That's a nice tooth," he murmured.<br><br>Yes, keep looking, you ugly bag of piss, Crake thought to himself. You just keep looking.<br><br>Macarde's eyes glazed over, mesmerized. Crake directed every ounce of his willpower at the smuggler. Your man's idea isn't so bad, when you think about it. A show of generosity now will only increase your standing in the eyes of your customers. They'll come flocking with their deals, offering the best cuts for the privilege of working with you. You'll own this town!<br><br>But Macarde was smarter than Rat. The tooth worked only on the weak- minded. He was resisting; Crake could see it on his face. Even bewitched as he was by the tooth, Macarde sensed that something was amiss.<br><br>A chill spread through Crake's body, something icier and more insidious than simple fear. The tooth was draining him. Hungover and weak as he was, he couldn't keep up the fight for long, and he'd already used his best efforts on Rat.<br><br>Give it up, he silently begged Macarde. Just give it up.<br><br>Then the smuggler blinked, and his gaze cleared. He stared at Crake, shocked. Crake's grin faded slowly.<br><br>"He's a daemonist!" Macarde cried, then pulled the pistol from his holster, put it to Crake's head, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Macarde was as surprised as Crake was. He'd forgotten that he'd loaded his pistol with only a single bullet. There was an instant's pause, then everything happened at once.<br><br>Frey's cutlass flew out of Macarde's belt, leaping ten feet across the room, past Droop-Eye and into the captain's waiting hands. Droop- Eye's final moments were spent staring in incomprehension as Frey drove the cutlass double-handed into his belly.<br><br>Macarde's bewilderment at having his cutlass stolen by invisible hands gave Crake the time he needed to gather himself. He drove a knee hard into the fat man's groin. Macarde's eyes bulged and he staggered back a step, making a faint squealing noise like a distressed piglet.<br><br>His hands still bound, Crake wrestled the revolver from Macarde's beefy fingers just as Rat shook off the effects of the tooth and drew his own cutlass back for a thrust. Crake swung the gun about and squeezed the trigger. This time, the hammer found the bullet. It discharged point-blank in Rat's face, blowing a geyser of red mist from the back of his skull with a deafening bang. He tottered a few steps on his heels and collapsed onto a heap of rope.<br><br>Macarde was stumbling toward the door, unwittingly blocking Bruiser's line of fire. As the last thug fought to get an angle, Frey dropped his cutlass, darted across the room, and scooped up the lever-action shotgun that Droop-Eye had left on the barrel. Bruiser shoved his boss behind him to get a clear shot at Crake and succeeded only in providing one for Frey, who unloaded the shotgun into his chest wi...</p><h2>Feet In The Clouds</h2><p>Feet in the Clouds</p><p>RICHARD ASKWITH is Associate Editor of the Independent and author of Feet in the Clouds: A Tale of Fell-Running and Obsession.&#39;A beautifully written, potted history of fell-running and famouse fell-runners.

This second volume, <i>More Dashing</i>, presents a further selection of letters that exude a zest for life and adventure characteristic of the man known to all as 'Paddy'. </p><p>Paddy's exuberant letters contain glimpses of the great and the good: a chance conversation with the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, when Paddy opens the wrong door, or a glass of ouzo under the pine trees with Harold Macmillan. They describe encounters with such varied figures as Jackie Onassis, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Oswald Mosley and Peter Mandelson, while also relating adventures with the humble: a 'pick-nick' with the stonemasons at Kardamyli, or a drunken celebration in the Cretan mountains with his old comrades from the Resistance, most of them simple shepherds and goatherds. Paddy was at ease in any company - unfailingly charming, boyish, gentle and fun.</p><p> Patrick Leigh Fermor has long been recognised as one of the greatest travel writers of his time. Nowhere is his restless curiosity and delight in language more dazzlingly displayed than in his letters, skilfully edited in this collection by Adam Sisman.</p></p><p></p><h2>Boom Baby Moon (March Tenth Book)</h2><p>A gentle parody of the best-selling children&#39;s book, Goodnight Moon pokes fun at the trappings of modern babyhood, including bedroom intercoms, fireproof clothing, Walkmans, and au pairs.

A stunning collection of revealing narratives that bears witness to wrenching changes in the American economy. Photographs.</p><p>Frisch ( A Shared Authority: Essays on the Craft and Meaning of Oral and Public History ) and documentary photographer Rogovin here collaborate on a mid-1980s portrait of the lives of 12 former steelworkers, male and female, in Buffalo, N.Y. PW saw only a fraction of the black-and-white photographs but these are illuminating examples of what Frisch calls "a presentation of self." Frisch's introduction thoughtfully describes Buffalo through deindustrialization and tentative revival. His interviews are earnest, detailed and sometimes redundant. The workers describe their work in steel, from running the furnaces to pouring molten steel, their family life and how they have coped with adversity. Some have made a successful transition while others struggle: one man is on welfare; another guards the empty steel plant where he once worked. Most striking are the sometimes xenophobic, often uninformed but heartfelt responses workers give to Frisch's very leading questions about the decline of the economy: they presage the large numbers of voters who supported Bill Clinton and H. Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential race. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kansas City In Vintage Postcards (MO) (Postcard History Series)</h2><p>Kansas City, Missouri, has long been a bustling center of activity in the heart of the Midwest, hosting the railroads that rambled through its stockyards and the jazz pioneers who made a lasting mark on music history.

As the first schools move south from Maine, their numbers increase until there are 25 million stripers coursing down the coast. This roiling seaside show also attracts bigger predators, swooping seabirds, and a fanatical brotherhood of fishermen.</p><p>Writer and angler David DiBenedetto followed the fall run, as this great migration is called, for three months in the autumn of 2001. To do so, he lived according to the rhythm of the tides and the stripers' night-owl tendencies. As the fish swam south, the author found himself pursuing them by every means that humans have conceived, from extreme surf casting to free diving.</p><p><em>On the Run</em> is much more than the story of the ultimate fishing road trip. It offers vivid portrayals of the zany and obsessive characters DiBenedetto met on his travels -- including the country's most daring fisherman; an underwater videographer who chucked his corporate job in favor of filming striped bass; and the reclusive angler who claims that catching the world-record striper in 1982 sent his life into a tailspin. Along his route, the author also delves into the natural history and biology of this great game fish, and depicts the colorful cultures of the seaside communities where the striped bass reigns supreme.</p><p>The power and savagery of nature is never more evident than during the stripers' fall run, and DiBenedetto captures it all in this engaging work. Whether you are an outdoor enthusiast, an adventure lover, or simply a fan of fine writing, <em>On the Run</em> will have you hooked from the start.</p></p><p><p>David DiBenedetto is the editor in chief of <em>Garden &amp; Gun</em> magazine.

"You'll get a mean rash." <p>"I'll keep that in mind," I hollered into the wind, my words quickly blown back into my face. </p><p>Truth was, whizzing in my neoprene bodysuit was the least of my worries. I was standing at the edge of the roiling Atlantic in Montauk, New York. Clouds covered the sliver of a moon, the chilly October night as black as the bottom of a well. In a few minutes I would follow Melnyk into the ocean. </p><p>We planned to lie on our backs, fishing rods held under our arms, and kick our way three hundred yards offshore. Once there, we would float on the current that ran parallel to the beach, casting live eels for striped bass. After we were carried for a half mile or so, we would kick back to where we started and begin the drift again. Melnyk, a Montauk local who invented this form of angling, calls it skishing (a cross between skiing and fishing, since large stripers often towed him like a water-skier). As one guide told me before my skishing adventure, Melnyk was on "the extreme end of extreme." </p><p>The night before our trip, a surf fisherman, with both feet on shore, had landed a fifty-pound striper, and Melnyk wanted to best that mark. He was sure the fish was an indication of a school of trophy striped bass in the area. There was no turning back. We huddled behind a large dune to zip our wet suits and run through an equipment check. Head-lamp? Check. Whistle? Check. Pliers? Check. Knife? Check. </p><p>"If a shark grabs me, I expect you to fight him off with your knife," said Melnyk, trying to loosen up the situation. His levity was lost on me. I knew enough about the area to realize that the threat of sharks was no joke. A little more than a decade back, a Montauk charter boat had landed a monstrous great white (seventeen feet, 3,427 pounds) that had been snacking on a dead whale not far from the point, and just that summer a fourteen-foot mako had been pilfering stripers from the ends of fishermen's lines and ramming boats near Cape Cod. Up and down the East Coast, 2001 had been the summer of the shark. </p><p>There were also rip currents, some of which ran at eight knots. If we got caught in the wrong place, we would be shot out into the ocean as if on a water-park ride. </p><p>"Let's do this before I chicken out," I said. </p><p>"Okay. Remember, this is a shore break. It's dangerous surf. These waves can pick you up and slam you on the beach. It'll ruin your week. Once we clear them it's easy sailing -- make that kicking." </p><p>We waded in. The surf zone was a cauldron of white water, and beyond it the sea's lumps melded with the sky. When the water reached our knees, we dropped on our backs and pulled on our flippers. With the waves rushing to shore, it was a clumsy endeavor, and twice I rolled face first into the water before succeeding. </p><p>"Ready?" yelled Melnyk. </p><p>"Ready." </p><p>"Kick, kick, kick, kick." </p><p>When my flippers gained purchase, I zipped ahead into the wash. </p><p>"Stay with me, Dave." </p><p>We were kicking side by side when the first breaker rushed over us. I swallowed a mouthful of seawater and bobbed to the surface. Melnyk hooted with delight. The next wave lifted me up and carried me tumbling back where I'd started. </p><p>"Come on, Dave. Kick, kick, kick!" coaxed Melnyk. I gathered myself and pushed off again. In less than thirty seconds we were out of the surf, rising and falling on the choppy waves of the ocean. At fifty-six degrees, the water breaching our wet suits was breath-stealing. </p><p>"Is this living or what?" screamed Melnyk. "We're on the edge, man." </p><p>"How much farther?" </p><p>"About a hundred kicks." </p><p>On the crest of each wave I could see the shore. TV sets were flashing muted blues and reds in the windows of the beach motels above the dunes. I found myself envious of the occupants, who had little fear of disappearing into the Atlantic. Suddenly there was a surface commotion just in front of our heads, like a broom slapping the water. "Just a flock of sea ducks riding out the weather," said Melnyk. "We probably scared the shit out of them." </p><p>"Likewise." </p><p>Eventually Melnyk yelled, "We're here, man." We stopped kicking. The thick wet suits provided enough buoyancy to keep us chest high in the gin-clear water. I flipped my headlamp on; it illuminated a circle in front of me, the strobe reaching toward the bottom. I could see my purple flippers flexing as I flutter-kicked to stabilize myself. I wondered what could see me from below, and inched closer to Melnyk. </p><p>Melnyk kept each eel in an individual sandwich-size Ziploc bag for easy handling. He passed one to me. It squirmed within its plastic confines as I hooked it through the jaw. With the hook in place I pulled hard, ripping the bag and freeing the eel. It danced on the end of my line. If I didn't cast soon, it would tie itself and the line into a slimy knot. </p><p>I turned my light off. Melnyk already had his eel in the water. He was floating about ten feet from me. His black neoprene hood combined with his surf rod rising from the surface made him look like a seagoing knight, his trusty steed a sea creature from Proteus's flock. As I went to cast, Melnyk's rod quivered, then bent deeply. He reared back on the fish, then yelled, "Oh baby, they're here."</p></p><h2>Gesar!: The Epic Tale of Tibet&#39;s Great Warrior-King (Tibetan Art and Culture)</h2><p>For young and old.</p><p>Elizabeth Cook is a freelance writer.

In this notable commentary, however, Marianne Meye Thompson shows how these two epistles provide a unique formulation of the gospel in terms of creation and reconciliation rather than justification by faith. In Colossians she finds an overarching narrative of the Bible&#39;s grand creation-redemption story and an important emphasis on the relationship between creation and Christology, while her exploration of Philemon casts brighter light on the significance of Paul&#39;s familial metaphors for the church and the meaning of new humanity in Christ. Throughout her work on these two epistles, Thompson continually connects her insights to theological concerns, making this volume an excellent addition to the Two Horizons series.</p><p>Marianne Meye Thompson is George Eldon Ladd Professor of New Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California, and an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church (USA).

Dellums represented California's Ninth Congressional District for twenty-seven years. He is now president of Healthcare International Management Company. He lives in Washington, D.C., and will teach at Brandeis University's Heller School in Waltham, Massachusetts, during the spring 2000 semester. <p>H. Lee Halterman was a member of Dellums's staff and his principal spokesman, as well as the director of policy for the House Armed Services Committee during Dellums' s chairmanship. He lives in San Francisco.</p>Dellums's first calling was to be a social worker. He found his second after a client inspired him "to get at the causes, rather than the symptoms, of individual dysfunction." Thus began his three-decade career as a leading progressive politician and social worker for the nation--or "black male bomb-thrower from Berkeley," as one congressman put it. In this overly earnest apologia, Dellums explains his many radical positions and how he stuck to them. He spends the most time on his greatest victories: helping promote the Congressional Black Caucus and pushing for U.S. sanctions against South Africa. He doesn't forget his failures, though, showing instead how they were in some ways successes. For example, the annual CBC alternative budget was ignored legislatively, but it earned "the respect, if not the support, of key members of the House." And if Dellums failed to kill the B-2 bomber program, he at least won "a partial victory--limiting the production of the planes." Such relentless optimism may seem to some like a political defense mechanism, but according to Dellums, it's a necessary trait for the progressive. For "the challenge is not so much to prevail at the moment as it is to remain faithful to the ideas and to the struggle, and to refuse to yield to the powerful temptation of cynicism." Although he frequently teeters on the brink of self-hagiography--the pitfall of all political memoirs--and his recounting (with the help of longtime aide Halterman) of political battles can be dry, Dellums shows that he's met this challenge well.

He pastored several churches in New England and founded the Bethel Bible Institute in Spencer, Massachusetts. (The school later became the Providence Bible Institute when it was relocated to Providence, Rhode Island.) Kenyon served as an evangelist for over twenty years. In 1931, he became a pioneer in Christian radio on the Pacific Coast with his show Kenyon's Church of the Air, where he earned the moniker "The Faith Builder." He also began the New Covenant Baptist Church in Seattle. In addition to his pastoral and radio ministries, Kenyon wrote extensively.<br></p><h2>Celle qui fuit et celle qui reste (L&#39;amie prodigieuse 3) (Folio) (French Edition)</h2><p>Spine creased, cover worn.

Already a best seller in Australia, <i>The Secret River</i> is the story of Grenville's ancestors, who wrested a new life from the alien terrain of Australia and its native people. London, 1806. William Thornhill, a Thames bargeman, is deported to the New South Wales colony in what would become Australia. In this new world of convicts and charlatans, Thornhill tries to pull his family into a position of power and comfort. When he rounds a bend in the Hawkesbury River and sees a gentle slope of land, he becomes determined to make the place his own. But, as uninhabited as the island appears, Australia is full of native people, and they do not take kindly to Thornhill's theft of their home.<br><br> <i>The Secret River</i> is the tale of Thornhill's deep love for his small corner of the new world, and his slow realization that if he wants to settle there, he must ally himself with the most despicable of the white settlers, and to keep his family safe, he must permit terrifying cruelty to come to innocent people.<br></p><p>Kate Grenville is one of Australia&#39;s best-loved authors. Her works of fiction have won numerous awards both in Australia and internationally. The Idea of Perfection won the 2001 Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction and became a long-running bestseller. In 2006 The Secret River won the Commonwealth Writers&#39; Prize and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Searching For The Secret River, the story behind this novel, is also available from Canongate, alongside her first novel, Lilian&#39;s Story, and The Lieutenant. Kate Grenville lives in Sydney.For contemporary Australians, a genealogical search might well lead back to the British prisoners, circa 1800, who were exiled to the no-man's-land of New South Wales. Orange Prize winner Grenville found out little about her own family, but the heritage she creates in this historical novel is both personal and believable. Audie Award winner Simon Vance narrates with only the slightest British accent. The moment he steps into dialogue, however, the characters come alive and distinct. These men were not murderers or hardened criminals, and Vance's ability to convey sensitivity behind the gruff exterior of their voices (or, in the case of a few, the lack of sensitivity) reaches refreshingly beyond the words on the printed page.

This volume documents their life, culture, traditions and celebrations.</p><p>If one picture is worth a thousand words, then the combination of text and images in <i>Nomads of Niger</i> adds up to the equivalent of a whole encyclopedia. The cover photograph alone tells you this will be a special journey; before you even reach the title page you've already been treated to several stunning portraits of a nomadic people known as the Wodaabe, "who number among the last nomads of Africa, indeed among the last nomads on earth." The landscape the Wodaabe inhabit is a harsh one: "In central Niger, between the great Sahara Desert and the grasslands, lies an immense steppe, scattered with scrawny bushes and skeletal trees. For nine months of the year hardly a drop of rain falls. The days are torrid, the nights sometimes freezing cold. And the harmattan, the hot wind out of the desert, blows up relentlessly, filling the air with a sandy haze." Across this no-man's land the Wodaabe herd their cattle, migrating north in the rainy season and south again in the dry months and leaving no trace of their travels as they go. <p> Photographer Carol Beckwith spent 18 months traveling with one particular band of Wodaabe, and her photographs concentrate on the family of a herdsman named Mokao and his family. <i>Nomads of Niger</i> is more than just a coffee-table book; it is also an informative and highly entertaining account of the lives, customs, rituals, and taboos of the Wodaabe reminiscent of the best of <i>National Geographic</i> magazine.</p>Belgian anthropologist Van Offelen banded with American photographer Beckwith to produce this stunning 1983 volume on the Wodaabe, the pastoral nomads of the West African Fulani people. Along with the 144 photographs are numerous line drawings and a healthy portion of Van Offelen's observations. This remains "recommended for area collections and for libraries where there is interest in the decorative arts of traditional societies" ( LJ 12/15/83).<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Covering Islam : How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World</h2><p>A penetrating look at the way in which experts, policy-makers and the media have dealt with the crisis in Iran and the Middle East. With examples, Said demonstrates that the government-business establishment has produced a portrait of Islam and Muslims based on ignorance, inaccuracy and prejudice.</p><p>While the 16 years that have passed since the first edition of this book hit the stands have been marked by an increase in sensitivity toward many ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities, the easy acceptance of stereotypes and prejudices in the portrayal, depiction of, and reporting about Islamic peoples has remained largely constant. In this updated version of this rigorous but engaging volume Edward Said looks at how American popular media has used and perpetuated a narrow and unfavorable image of Islamic peoples, and how this has prevented understanding while providing a fictitious common enemy for the diverse American populace.In this landmark work, for which he has written a new Introduction, one of our foremost public thinkers examines to origins and repercussions of the media&#39;s monolithic images of Islam. Combining political commentary with literary criticism, Edward Said reveals the hidden assumptions and distortions of fact that underlie even the most &#34;objective&#34; coverage of the Islamic world. In so doing, Covering Islam continues Said&#39;s lifelong investigation of the ways in which language not only describes but also defines political reality.</p><h2>No Laughing Matter: Chalk Talks on Alcohol</h2><p>A recovered alcoholic, whose lecture series has been widely used in government and private rehabilitation programs, makes an in-depth presentation on alcoholism that covers its causes, effects, treatment, and sources of further information and assistance</p><p></p><h2>Animals Every Child Should Know</h2><p>Briefly characterizes sixteen animals common to the forests and fields</p><p></p><h2>365 Health &amp; Happiness Boosters</h2><p><p><b><strong>You Can be Happy No Matter Your Challenges</strong></b></p><p><strong>From MJ Ryan, New York Times bestselling author and international expert on change and personal fulfilment, comes&nbsp;<em>365 Health &amp; Happiness Boosters</em>&nbsp;to help you be happier no matter who you are or what your challenges.</strong></p><p><strong>Happiness begets happiness.</strong>&nbsp;When a person is happy, the feeling ripples out to others nearby.

His previous biographies have included works on Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker. He lives in New York.Jazz critic Giddins's latest subject will probably surprise those who think of Bing Crosby (1903-1977) as "a square old man who made orange-juice commercials" and sang "White Christmas" every year on TV. Giddins reminds us that, in the 1920s and '30s, Crosby was a very jazzy singer indeed: "the first white performer to appreciate and assimilate the genius of Louis Armstrong." This sober, comprehensive biography lacks the thematic breadth and action-packed sentences that made Giddins's Visions of Jazz so memorable, but it's a perceptive portrait of Crosby as a man, a singer, a radio personality and a budding movie star in the loose, creative years before he hardened into a monument. Giddins's account of Crosby's middle-class, Irish-American youth in Washington State astutely stresses this singer's years of Jesuit schooling, which made him unusually well educated for a performer and grounded him in values that contributed to the modesty, reserve and self-confidence American audiences found so appealing. Tracing Crosby's rise through vaudeville, Paul Whiteman's band, short films and radio shows, Giddins also offers a mini-history of technology's impact on popular music, most notably Crosby's famous ability to use a microphone to create a more intimate singing style. There's a bit too much background on minor characters and on forgettable films before readers arrive at The Road to Singapore, which launched Crosby's epochal partnership with Bob Hope. But Giddins amply makes his case that Crosby "came along when American entertainment was at a crossroads [and] showed it which road to take." Photos not seen by PW. (Jan.) Forecast: Giddins has long been popular among serious jazz fans, and his name recognition jumped after Visions of Jazz won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998. The first volume of a multipart biography, this book will be further boosted by advertising and an eight-city author tour, including an appearance on Ken Burns's PBS documentary, Jazz, airing in January. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On History</h2><p>Few historians have done more to change the way we see the past than Eric Hobsbawm.

How does God&#39;s election correspond to our freedom? Why did Jesus have to die? Why doesn&#39;t God save everybody? These are questions most believers and seekers have asked, and they are biblically answered by author David Clotfelter. Contrasting the theologies of Jonathan Edwards with George MacDonald, the author reconciles the difficult doctrines of divine judgement and predestination.

David is the author of <i>Sinners in the Hands of a Good God: Reconciling Divine Judgment and Mercy</i>. He and his wife, Lisa, have two children and reside in Northridge, California.We do well to keep in mind that the person who is esteemed by God is not the one who waxes eloquent as he develops one biblical idea to the detriment of others, but the one who is humble and contrite in spirit and who "trembles" at God's word (Isa. 66:2). We may not always find it easy to reconcile the various truths of the Bible. Nevertheless, we must humbly keep in check both our desire for logical consistency and our outrage at truths we do not like. God will no doubt reward our search by giving us ever-greater insight into the relationships among the truths He has revealed about Himself. We may be quite sure that all that God does is, in fact, logical and self-consistent. But we should not presume to reject that which we have not had the patience or humility to accept on God's terms.<br></p><h2>Just Add Color: Geometric Patterns: 30 Original Illustrations To Color, Customize, and Hang</h2><p><p>Who doesn't love to color?

Only the knights of the Table had ever been permitted to ride them, for they were bred to carry kings.</i> <br> <i>But there were no more than a handful of Arthur&#x2019;s knights left now.</i> <br> <i>When Arthur fell at Camlann&#x2014;and it seemed to all as if the day were lost&#x2014;it had been Guinevere who had taken command of his army&#x2014;and they had been eager to have someone, anyone, lead them. That, Mordred had not expected&#x2014;that she, of all people, would appear on the battlefield in borrowed armor at the head of a vast army. From the moment Arthur had sent her into exile, she had been preparing for this day. But she had come too late to save her husband and lord. Camelot had fallen.</i> <br> <i>She had given her dying husband into the care of the Lady of the Lake. She had taken his sword from his death-cold fingers.</i> <br> <i>And she had followed the fleeing Mordred and his army with all her host.</i> <br> <i>Mordred had broken Arthur&#x2019;s army at Camlann, and the years of fighting that had preceded it had stripped Britain of knights and fighting men. But Guinevere&#x2019;s army did not ride clad in mail and wearing steel. It was made up of Druids and monks, nuns and sorceresses&#x2014;the Old Ways and the New Faith coming together to oppose an enemy who would destroy all that was. And beside Guinevere rode The Merlin.</i> <br> <i>Nimue had been the first of Mordred&#x2019;s allies to desert him, and with the breaking of the spell she had put upon him, The Merlin was freed. When he had learned of Arthur&#x2019;s death, his wrath had been terrible to see.</i> <br> <i>Across all of Britain the two armies rode, one pursuing, one fleeing. And slowly, one by one, Mordred&#x2019;s allies and vassals deserted him. Arthur had died in the springtide. It was autumn when Mordred was brought to bay.</i> <br> <i>This was the end.</i> <br> <i>The trees were leafless, now, and the wind was cold. Behind Guinevere stood her husband&#x2019;s army and her own, each man and woman waiting with a deadly implacable patience to witness the end of the man who had destroyed everything they had worked so long to build. Before her stood the ancient oak tree that Mordred had once meant to be The Merlin&#x2019;s eternal tomb.</i> <br> <i>She would gladly have slain the black snake who destroyed her happiness and her husband&#x2019;s kingdom, but Mordred was so imbued with the powers of Death Itself he could not die. No earthly weapon could slay him&#x2014;but he could be bound, as he had intended The Merlin to be bound. And since his own magics had prepared the ancient oak, it was all the more fitting that the tree be the vessel to hold him.&#x2026; </i> <br> <i>Guinevere heard muffled shouting and the clink of chains. She looked to her right. Here came the Bishop of England in his red and white robes, carrying a golden cross atop a long pole. Beside him walked the Archdruid of Eire, barefoot, with spirals of woad covering every inch of his skin, his only garment a tabard of white bull&#x2019;s-hide. Behind them walked the White Horse Woman&#x2014;whom Guinevere&#x2019;s ancestors had worshipped&#x2014;the Lady of Apples, priests and holy people of every faith Britain held.</i> <br> <i>Before them walked The Merlin.</i> <br> <i>And behind them came Mordred, dragged by the last of Arthur&#x2019;s knights. His hands were bound with iron and silk and ivy, his mouth had been sewn shut, his body was weighted down with a hundredweight of silver chains, each link carved with runes of blessing and protection. But his eyes were unblinded, and they flashed with fury.</i> <br> <i>The Merlin began to chant.</i> <br> <i>The knights pushed Mordred toward the oak&#x2014;not with their hands, but with stangs made of sacred oak.</i> <br> <i>And when his body touched it, Mordred began to sink into the tree as if its wood were softened wax. He struggled, eyes wild with anger and power. Still, the knights thrust him backward, and still The Merlin chanted. In a moment more it would be done.</i> <br> <i>Then to her horror, Guinevere saw that Mordred had torn loose the sinews that had sewn his mouth shut. He roared out a single terrible word. The knights pushing him forward fell to their knees, their screams drowned in those of the holy ones who had come to see justice done.</i> <br> <i>But The Merlin had not fallen&#x2014;and he shouted three syllables she did not understand, and did not want to. There was a flash and a roar. Brightness. Darkness. Guinevere cried out, fighting to control her panicked mount.</i> <br> <i>When she could see again, the oak&#x2019;s bark was seamless. The Merlin still stood before the oak, but his face was gray with terrible pain and weakness now, and he leaned heavily upon his staff for support. There was no sign of Mordred.</i> <br> <i>The Merlin staggered forward, summoning his failing strength. As he pointed at the oak, words of fire wrote themselves into the wood.</i> <br>Oh Thou who wouldst meddle in the affairs of Light and Darkness, Touch Not the Sacred Oak sealed by Merlin&#x2019;s Own Hand, for herein lies imprisoned the traitorous son of the Great Bear: Medraut Kinslayer the Accursed. Flee, lest his undying evil take you for its own! <br> <i>The Merlin turned at last, to look at Guinevere. &#x201c;It is finished,&#x201d; he said, in a voice flat with exhaustion.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Spirit shivered in the chill of the Girls&#x2019; Locker Room, but as cold as it was, she still wasn&#x2019;t in any hurry to get changed for class. <i>I never thought I&#x2019;d miss Mr. Gail and Mr. Wallis,</i> she thought ruefully. <i>But at least I guess I understood them. They might have been horrible, but they weren&#x2019;t killers.</i> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the way it was supposed to go. <br>She&#x2019;d thought&#x2014;oh she&#x2019;d been so na�ve!&#x2014;that once the kids had routed the Shadow Knights at the Sadie Hawkins Day Dance, the trouble would be over. Whatever the Shadow Knights had wanted to do on February 2nd, they&#x2019;d failed. Nobody had died. People had gotten hurt, but nobody had <i>died.</i> They&#x2019;d proved they could win. <br>It hadn&#x2019;t changed anything. And what was even scarier was, it was becoming more and more obvious that the Bad Guys weren&#x2019;t the secret society within Oakhurst called the Gatekeepers. They weren&#x2019;t a bunch of faceless Shadow Knights. They were the Oakhurst faculty. <br>At least the ones who were left. People kept vanishing here, and if you were smart you pretended you didn&#x2019;t notice. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d better get moving,</i> she thought, closing her locker reluctantly. At least she wasn&#x2019;t the only one here trying to delay the inevitable. She turned to head for the gym. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Spirit, &#x2019;scuze me&#x2014;&#x201d; Trinity Brown started to walk past her, then paused. &#x201c;You know, when you got here you were, like, a waif. You <i>do</i> realize you&#x2019;ve gotten all ripped, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Trinity chuckled. &#x201c;Wish I was. Guess I was born to be a string.&#x201d; She held up her hand in a half wave and walked on. <br>Spirit blinked in surprise, staring after Trinity. She hadn&#x2019;t even realized Trinity&#x2014;who was <i>not</i> a string, merely supermodel-lean&#x2014;knew her name. It was kind of ironic&nbsp;&#x2026; now that Oakhurst really <i>was</i> out to kill them, the kids were a lot kinder to each other than they had been when she had arrived in September. One of the first things she&#x2019;d learned about Oakhurst was that friendships weren&#x2019;t encouraged. <br> <i>But I</i> have <i>friends. Good friends. I don&#x2019;t know what would have happened to me without Loch and Burke and Addie&nbsp;&#x2026; </i> <br> <i>And Muirin.</i> <br>She just hoped Muirin was still her friend. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d better get going.</i> She looked down at herself. Trinity was right: she <i>was</i> ripped. <i>If I live to graduate, the only job I&#x2019;d qualify for is superhero,</i> she thought bitterly. <i>Or maybe government assassin. I sure don&#x2019;t know how to do anything else.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The class was <i>Systema.</i> It was a kind of Russian martial art that focused on controlling the joints of one&#x2019;s opponent. What it meant in practice was that they were all supposed to try to kill each other. When Anastus Ovcharenko started teaching the course, they&#x2019;d worked out on mats. Now they worked out on the bare wood floor. Spirit and Trinity stood at the back of the group of students (not that something like that would save you). Muirin should have been here, too, but these days Muirin didn&#x2019;t spend a lot of time in her classes&#x2014;and she saw plenty of Ovcharenko out of them. <br>He was already there, of course, smiling cheerfully as he waited for the last of them to arrive. Ovcharenko was always cheerful&#x2014;especially when he was about to hurt somebody. He always picked someone to spar with while the rest of them paired off against each other. He said it was to demonstrate the proper techniques. Spirit was pretty sure it was more about punishment. Dylan Williams (the official ringleader of the rebellion back in February) had been his favorite chew-toy for weeks, but he&#x2019;d managed to put Dylan in the infirmary yesterday, and Dylan wasn&#x2019;t here. <br> <i>I don&#x2019;t care who he picks today as long as it isn&#x2019;t me,</i> Spirit thought fervently. <br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Ovcharenko said, clapping his hands together and smiling. &#x201c;Who wants to dance with Anastus today? Ah! I know! You! Come here&#x2014;we will have fun together, eh?&#x201d; <br>He smiled and nodded encouragingly. Everyone shifted uneasily, until they were all spread out in a ragged line. For one horrified moment Spirit thought Ovcharenko had chosen her after all. <br>But he was pointing at Trinity. <br>&#x201c;You! Little girl! It is Trinity Brown, yes? You will come and dance with Anastus, yes? Come, come. I promise you I will be gentle.&#x201d; <br>Nobody laughed. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Trinity said. She looked terrified&#x2014;but utterly determined. Spirit glanced at her in shock. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let you hurt me.&#x201d; <br>Ovcharenko smiled and began to walk toward Trinity. &#x201c;Ah, but pain makes us strong, <i>dorogoi,</i> and we must all do many things we&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Before Ovcharenko reached her, Trinity turned and ran. For an instant the sound of her bare feet against the wood floor was the loudest sound in the gym. <br>Then Ovcharenko began to laugh. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>At least Ovcharenko was so amused by Trinity bailing that he hadn&#x2019;t picked out a new sparring partner, but the session had still been rough. <i>Even my bruises have bruises,</i> Spirit thought tiredly. <br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; <br>Burke was leaning against the wall as she walked out of the gym. Spirit looked around quickly, but there wasn&#x2019;t anybody in sight. Not that she expected there to be: Burke Hallows was a Combat Mage, and Combat Mages noticed <i>everything.</i> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d; she asked. The five of them spent as little time together in public as possible. If Oakhurst had been a place where real friendship was discouraged in favor of competition before, well, now it was actually dangerous to show that you liked someone. <br>&#x201c;The last class of the day is magic practice,&#x201d; Burke said, as if Spirit needed reminding. <br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m <i>still</i> the only student at Hogwarts West without any.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky,&#x201d; Burke said gloomily. Then he smiled. &#x201c;But the real reason I&#x2019;m here is to grab a minute with my girl.&#x201d; <br>He reached out a hand, and Spirit moved gratefully into his arms. The only bright spot in the last two months was Burke. They&#x2019;d started out playing boy-and-girlfriend as a ruse to keep Breakthrough&#x2019;s suspicion away. But Burke hadn&#x2019;t been playing, and neither had she. <br>Burke hugged her. &#x201c;Ow,&#x201d; Spirit said ruefully, and Burke chuckled. <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said. He started to let go, but Spirit held on. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to hurt anyway. And I&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; Burke said, kissing the top of her head. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br>Spirit closed her eyes tightly, fighting to keep from ruining this brief moment of happiness with tears. Nobody dared go easy on anybody in <i>Systema</i>&#x2014;not with Ovcharenko watching all of them. It was fight or&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Well, she wasn&#x2019;t completely sure of what &#x201c;or&#x201d; involved, except that she probably wouldn&#x2019;t like it much. <br>But if not for the fact Oakhurst was trying to kill her the way it had killed her family, this would have been the most wonderful time of her life. Burke was nothing like the kind of boyfriend she&#x2019;d imagined for herself when she&#x2019;d dreamed about someday dating and falling in love. But she <i>did</i> love him. And she knew he loved her. <br> <i>And just think, I wouldn&#x2019;t have met him if I hadn&#x2019;t come to Thunderdome Academy.</i> <br>&#x201c;Do you think we can all get together after dinner?&#x201d; she asked, deliberately keeping her voice low. <br>&#x201c;Loch&#x2019;s making arrangements,&#x201d; Burke said against her hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the details. He hasn&#x2019;t been able to talk to Muirin, though.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Funny thing,&#x201d; Spirit said snarkily, and Burke snorted. <br>Despite her mocking words, Spirit was honestly worried about Muirin. For as long as Spirit had known her, Muirin had chafed at the restrictions of life at Oakhurst&#x2014;the dress code, the dreary school uniforms, the complete lack of social life. Breakthrough&#x2019;s arrival had changed all that. Madison Lane-Rider had started courting Muirin early, and Muirin had been more than willing to play along. As far as anyone with Breakthrough knew, Muirin Shae was drooling with the desire to become a Shadow Knight and join the international party crowd. <br>It was a good act. <br>At least Spirit hoped it was an act. So far Muirin seemed to love the glamour and excitement of playing double agent: the things she&#x2019;d told Spirit and the others about Breakthrough&#x2019;s inner workings had saved them more than once. But eventually Muirin was going to have to pick one side or the other&nbsp;&#x2026; and Spirit wasn&#x2019;t quite sure which one it would be. <br> <i>Breakthrough&#x2019;s offering her money, freedom, glamour&#x2014;and what can we offer her? The chance to get fed to demons. Not much of a choice.</i> <br>&#x201c;We have to get out of here,&#x201d; she said desperately. <i>Before Breakthrough makes us just disappear. Or worse.</i> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Burke said. &#x201c;I wish I could say&#x2014;&#x201d; Suddenly he pushed her away. She opened her mouth to protest, but then she saw movement at the end of the hall. Someone was coming. <br>They didn&#x2019;t dare be seen together. If anyone knew about them, Oakhurst would manage to make both of them wish they&#x2019;d never met. <br>She turned away, shrugging her bag full of sweaty gym clothes higher on her shoulder. She forced herself not to look back, not to wave, not to smile, as Burke walked away. <br>At least she could be pretty sure he&#x2019;d still be here at dinner. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>A few minutes later, Spirit opened the door to her room. She was lucky&#x2014;having a free hour after <i>Systema</i> meant she didn&#x2019;t have to shower in the gym like everyone else&#x2014;but right now the bathroom seemed too far away. She flopped down on the couch, wincing again at the pain of strained and bruised muscles. <br> <i>I remember when I thought we could win,</i> she thought tiredly. <i>I remember when I thought being here was just an accident&#x2014;a horrible accident, but an accident.</i> <br>When Oakhurst had sent for her, they&#x2019;d told her that her parents had arranged for Oakhurst to take care of her. Only it was just another lie. Her family&#x2014;just like the families of every other kid here&#x2014;had been murdered by the Shadow Knights. The bad guys found out you had magic, your family died, you ended up at Oakhurst. <br> <i>We have to get out of here.</i> They&#x2019;d all agreed about that after the February dance, but it wasn&#x2019;t as easy as that. They had no money and no families, and they were in the middle of Montana. And Oakhurst wouldn&#x2019;t just let them walk away. Until they had a <i>good</i> plan, they had to hide right here, ...</p><h2>Of Love and Shadows</h2><p>Isabel Allende transports us to a Latin American country in the grip of a military dictatorship, where Irene Beltran, an upperclass journalist, and Francisco Leal, a photographer son of a Marxist professor together discover a hideous crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also discover how far they dare go in search of the truth in a nation of terror . . . and how very much they risk.</p><p>Isabel Allende transports us to a Latin American country in the grip of a military dictatorship, where Irene Beltran, an upperclass journalist, and Francisco Leal, a photographer son of a Marxist professor together discover a hideous crime.

Elizabeth, an emotionally fragile mother with a history of alcoholism, must help her daughter, Rosie, navigate similar perils. Susan Denaker&#39;s composed performance makes this family drama difficult to ignore. Rather than using overwrought tones to depict the friction between mother and daughter, Denaker devises distinct voices for each character and delivers them evenly, allowing for quieter, more likable characters--like the ironic James, Elizabeth&#39;s husband--to temper the strife. Denaker&#39;s calm adds depth to these relationships, and the manipulation and power struggles that go with them.

The dreamer behind this great Imperial vision was Nikolai Rezanov &#x2013; diplomat, adventurer, courtier, millionaire and gambler. His quest to plant Russian colonies from Siberia to California led him to San Francisco, where he was captivated by Conchita, the fifteen-year-old daughter of the Spanish Governor, who embodied his dreams of both love and empire. From the glittering court of Catherine the Great to the wilds of the New World, Matthews conjures a brilliantly original portrait of one of Russia's most eccentric Empire-builders.</p></p><p><p>Owen Matthews was born in London and spent part of his childhood in America. He studied Modern History at Oxford University before beginning his career as a journalist in Bosnia. In 1995 he accepted a job at <i>The Moscow Times</i>, a daily English-language newspaper. He also freelanced for a number of publications including <i>The Times</i>, the <i>Spectator </i>and the <i>Independent</i>. In 1997, he became a correspondent at <i>Newsweek </i>magazine in Moscow where he covered the second Chechen war, as well as politics and society. Owen was also one of the first journalists to witness the start of the US bombing in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan, 2001, and went on to cover the invasion of Iraq, 2003. His first book on Russian history, <i>Stalin's Children</i>, was published to great critical acclaim in 2008. Owen is currently <i>Newsweek </i>magazine's bureau chief in Moscow, where he lives with his wife and two children.</p><p>&#x201c;Rezanov is the central character in Owen Matthews's enthralling account of Russia's great misfire: its attempt to colonise America. Many know that Russia sold Alaska to America, rather cheaply in 1867, fearing that it had become indefensible. But few know how it had become Russian in the first place . . . <i>Glorious Misadventures </i>is in part this extraordinary man's biography . . . His voyage to the Pacific, with shipmates even more mercurial, reads like an implausibly lively historical novel . . . The exotic personalities and adventures come against a backdrop of geopolitical tussles between France, Spain, Russia and Britain. Mr Matthews depicts them neatly, and paints enjoyable cameos . . . The book bursts with telling details, many of them gruesome . . . [An] exemplary account of adventures that could have changed the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;A swashbuckling Tsarist Russian in America ... Told by Matthews, the story loses none of its strangeness and its swashbuckling verve, reading at times like a cross between Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness </i>and Gogol's the <i>Government Inspector</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Deftly chronicle[d]. So the settlements are cold, the men are drunk, the trade is slow, but Matthews treats it all with an amused dryness that's as quintessentially British as good gin. The many digressions are in the service of a story that would make a fine Hollywood film.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Newsweek</i></p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that early in the 19th Century--as Napoleon was on the march--Russia's Tsar Alexander I sent a vainglorious, hotheaded seafaring courtier named Rezanov to conquer California for the Russian empire? Obviously, Rezanov's mission didn't succeed (though he made a killing in "soft gold" in Sitka and Alaska en route--harvesting thousands of seal skins, which the Chinese bought at premium prices). In Glorious Misadventures: Nikolai Rezanov and the Dream of a Russian America, Owen Matthews thrillingly relates this swashbuckling, Vernean, and entirely true chapter of forgotten history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Liesl Schillinger, Daily Beast</i></p><p>&#x201c;Matthews is wonderful at pacing the history of Russia's various eastward fur-trapping journeys and voyages; whether the cast of energetic, clever and violent fur traders are crossing Siberia by sleigh or the Atlantic and Pacific by ship, he never rushes, he never lags.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>&#x201c;Drawing on diaries and other sources, Mr. Matthews weaves a tale of courage and chicanery, avarice and incompetence . . .

A Pulitzer-Prize winning writer for the Los Angeles Times, Moehringer grew up fatherless in pub-heavy Manhasset, New York, in a ramshackle house crammed with cousins and ruled by an eccentric, unkind grandfather. Desperate for a paternal figure, he turns first to his father, a DJ whom he can only access via the radio (Moehringer calls him The Voice and pictures him as "talking smoke"). When The Voice suddenly disappears from the airwaves, Moehringer turns to his hairless Uncle Charlie, and subsequently, Uncle Charlie's place of employment--a bar called Dickens that soon takes center stage. While Moehringer may occasionally resort to an overwrought metaphor (the footsteps of his family sound like "storm troopers on stilts"), his writing moves at a quick clip and his tale of a dysfunctional but tightly knit community is warmly told. "While I fear that we're drawn to what abandons us, and to what seems most likely to abandon us, in the end I believe we're defined by what embraces us," Moehringer says, and his story makes us believe it. <i>--Brangien Davis</i><strong>J.R.

Alarmingly, the greatest income gap is not between the 1 percent and the 99 percent, but within the wealthiest 1 percent of our nation--as the merely wealthy are left behind by the rapidly expanding fortunes of the new global super-rich. Forget the 1 percent; <i>Plutocrats</i> proves that it is the wealthiest 0.1 percent who are outpacing the rest of us at break-neck speed.<br> <br> What&#x2019;s changed is more than numbers. Today, most colossal fortunes are new, not inherited--amassed by perceptive businessmen who see themselves as deserving victors in a cut-throat international competition. As a transglobal class of successful professionals, today&#x2019;s self-made oligarchs often feel they have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back home. Bringing together the economics and psychology of these new super-rich, <i>Plutocrats </i>puts us inside a league very much of its own, with its own rules.<br> <br> The closest mirror to our own time is the late nineteenth century Gilded Age--the era of powerful robber barons&#x2019; like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Then as now, emerging markets and innovative technologies collided to produce unprecedented wealth for more people than ever in human history. Yet those at the very top benefited far more than others--and from this pinnacle they exercised immense and unchecked power in their countries. Today&#x2019;s closest analogue to these robber barons can be found in the turbulent economies of India, Brazil, and China, all home to ferocious market competition and political turmoil. But wealth, corruption, and populism are no longer constrained by national borders, so this new Gilded Age is already transforming the economics of the West as well. <i>Plutocrats</i> demonstrates how&nbsp; social upheavals generated by the first Gilded Age may pale in comparison to what is in store for us, as the wealth of the entire globalized world is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.<br> <br> Cracking open the tight-knit world of the new global super-rich is Chrystia Freeland, an acclaimed business journalist who has spent nearly two decades reporting on the new transglobal elite. She parses an internal Citigroup memo that urges clients to design portfolios around the international Plutonomy&#x201d; and not the national rest&#x201d;; follows Russian, Mexican, and Indian oligarchs during the privatization boom as they manipulate the levers of power to commandeer their local economies; breaks down the gender divide between the vast female-managed middle class&#x2019; and the world&#x2019;s one thousand billionaires; shows how, by controlling both the economic and political institutions of their nation, the richest members of China&#x2019;s National People&#x2019;s Congress have amassed more wealth than every branch of American government combined--the president, his cabinet, the justices of the Supreme Court, and both houses of Congress.<br> <br> Though the results can be shocking, Freeland dissects the lives of the world&#x2019;s wealthiest individuals with empathy, intelligence, and deep insight. Brightly written, powerfully researched, and propelled by fascinating original interviews with the plutocrats themselves, <i>Plutocrats </i>is a tour-de-force of social and economic history, and the definitive examination of inequality in our time.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>CHRYSTIA&nbsp;FREELAND is the Editor of Thomson Reuters Digital, following years of service at the <i>Financial Times</i> both in New York and London.

What were the luxuries have become the necessaries of life. The laborer has now more comforts than the farmer had a few generations ago. The farmer has more luxuries than the landlord had, and is more richly clad and better housed. The landlord has books and pictures rarer and appointments more artistic than the king could then obtain.<br> &#x2014;Andrew Carnegie</p><p>Branko Milanovic is an economist at the World Bank. He first became interested in income inequality studying for his PhD in the 1980s in his native Yugoslavia, where he discovered it was officially viewed as a &#x201c;sensitive&#x201d; subject&#x2014;which meant one the ruling regime didn&#x2019;t want its scholars to look at too closely. That wasn&#x2019;t a huge surprise; after all, the central ideological promise of socialism was to deliver a classless society.</p><p>But when Milanovic moved to Washington, he discovered a curious thing. Americans were happy to celebrate their super-rich and, at least sometimes, worry about their poor. But putting those two conversations together and talking about economic inequality was pretty much taboo.</p><p>&#x201c;I was once told by the head of a prestigious think tank in Washington, D.C., that the think tank&#x2019;s board was very unlikely to fund any work that had income or wealth inequality in its title,&#x201d; Milanovic, who wears a beard and has a receding hairline and teddy bear build, explained in a recent book. &#x201c;Yes, they would finance anything to do with poverty alleviation, but inequality was an altogether different matter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Because &#x2018;my&#x2019; concern with the poverty of some people actually projects me in a very nice, warm glow: I am ready to use my money to help them. Charity is a good thing; a lot of egos are boosted by it and many ethical points earned even when only tiny amounts are given to the poor. But inequality is different: Every mention of it raises in fact the issue of the appropriateness or legitimacy of my income.&#x201d;</p><p>The point isn&#x2019;t that the super-elite are reluctant to display their wealth&#x2014;that is, after all, at least part of the purpose of yachts, couture, vast homes, and high-profile big-buck philanthropy. But when the discussion shifts from celebratory to analytical, the super-elite get nervous. One Wall Street Democrat, who has held big jobs in Washington and at some of America&#x2019;s top financial institutions, told me President Barack Obama had alienated the business community by speaking about &#x201c;the rich.&#x201d; It would be best not to refer to income differences at all, the banker said, but if the president couldn&#x2019;t avoid singling out the country&#x2019;s top earners, he should call them &#x201c;affluent.&#x201d; Naming them as &#x201c;rich,&#x201d; he told me, sounded divisive&#x2014;something the rich don&#x2019;t want to be. Striking a similar tone, Bill Clinton, in his 2011 book, <i>Back to Work</i>, faulted Barack Obama for how he talks about those at the top. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t attack them for their success,&#x201d; President Clinton wrote, attributing to that softer touch his greater success in getting those at the top to accept higher taxes.</p><p>Robert Kenny, a Boston psychologist who specializes in counseling the super-elite, agrees. He told an interviewer that &#x201c;often the word &#x2018;rich&#x2019; becomes a pejorative. It rhymes with &#x2018;bitch.&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve been in rooms and seen people stand up and say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Bob Kenny and I&#x2019;m rich.&#x2019; And then they burst into tears.&#x201d;</p><p>It is not just the super-rich who don&#x2019;t like to talk about rising income inequality. It can be an ideologically uncomfortable conversation for many of the rest of us, too. That&#x2019;s because even&#x2014;or perhaps particularly&#x2014;in the view of its most ardent supporters, global capitalism wasn&#x2019;t supposed to work quite this way.</p><p>Until the past few decades, the received wisdom among economists was that income inequality would be fairly low in the preindustrial era&#x2014;overall wealth and productivity were fairly small, so there wasn&#x2019;t that much for an elite to capture&#x2014;then spike during industrialization, as the industrialists and industrial workers outstripped farmers (think of China today). Finally, in fully industrialized or postindustrial societies, income inequality would again decrease as education became more widespread and the state played a bigger, more redistributive role.</p><p>This view of the relationship between economic development and income inequality was first and most clearly articulated by Simon Kuznets, a Belarusian-born immigrant to the United States. Kuznets illustrated his theory with one of the most famous graphs in economics&#x2014;the Kuznets curve, an upside-down U that traces the movement of society as its economy becomes more sophisticated and productive, from low inequality, to high inequality, and back down to low inequality.</p><p>Writing in the early years of the industrial revolution, and without the benefit of Kuznets&#x2019;s data and statistical analysis, Alexis de Tocqueville came up with a similar prediction: &#x201c;If one looks closely at what has happened to the world since the beginning of society, it is easy to see that equality is prevalent only at the historical poles of civilization. Savages are equal because they are equally weak and ignorant. Very civilized men can all become equal because they all have at their disposal similar means of attaining comfort and happiness. Between these two extremes is found inequality of condition, wealth, knowledge&#x2014;the power of the few, the poverty, ignorance, and weakness of the rest.&#x201d;</p><p>If you believe in capitalism&#x2014;and nowadays pretty much the whole world does&#x2014;the Kuznets curve was a wonderful theory. Economic progress might be brutal and bumpy and create losers along the way. But once we reached that Tocquevillian plateau of all being &#x201c;very civilized men&#x201d; (yes, men!), we would all share in the gains. Until the late 1970s, the United States, the world&#x2019;s poster child of capitalism, was also an embodiment of the Kuznets curve. The great postwar expansion was also the period of what economists have dubbed the Great Compression, when inequality shrank and most Americans came to think of themselves as middle class. This was the era when, in the words of Harvard economist Larry Katz, &#x201c;Americans grew together.&#x201d; That seemed to be the natural shape of industrial capitalism.</p><p>Even the Reagan Revolution rode on the coattails of this paradigm&#x2014;trickle-down economics, after all, emphasizes the trickle. But in the late 1970s, things started to change. The income of the middle class started to stagnate and those at the top began to pull away from everyone else. This shift was most pronounced in the United States, but by the twenty-first century, surging income inequality had become a worldwide phenomenon, visible in most of the developed Western economies as well as in the rising emerging markets.</p><p>The switch from the America of the Great Compression to the America of the 1 percent is still so recent that our intuitive beliefs about how capitalism works haven&#x2019;t caught up with the reality. In fact, surging income inequality is such a strong violation of our expectations that most of us don&#x2019;t realize it is happening.</p><p>That is what Duke University behavioral economist Dan Ariely discovered in a 2011 experiment with Michael Norton of Harvard Business School. Ariely showed people the wealth distribution in the United States, where the top 20 percent own 84 percent of the total wealth, and in Sweden, where the share of the top 20 percent is just 36 percent. Ninety-two percent of respondents said they preferred the wealth distribution of Sweden to that of the United States today. Ariely then asked his subjects to give their ideal distribution of wealth for the United States. Respondents preferred that the top 20 percent own just 32 percent of total wealth, an even more equitable distribution than Sweden&#x2019;s. When it comes to wealth inequality, Americans would prefer to live in Sweden&#x2014;or in the late 1950s compared to the United States today. And they would like kibbutz-style egalitarianism best of all.</p><p>But the gap between the data and our intuition is not a good reason to ignore what is going on. And to understand how American capitalism&#x2014;and capitalism around the world&#x2014;is changing, you have to look at what is happening at the very top. That focus isn&#x2019;t class war; it&#x2019;s arithmetic. Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former secretary of the Treasury, is hardly a radical. Yet he points out that America&#x2019;s economic growth over the past decade has been so unevenly shared that, for the middle class, &#x201c;for the first time since the Great Depression, focusing on redistribution makes more sense than focusing on growth.&#x201d;</p><p>The skew toward the very top is so pronounced that you can&#x2019;t understand overall economic growth figures without taking it into account. As in a school whose improved test scores are due largely to the stellar performance of a few students, the surging fortunes at the very top can mask stagnation lower down the income distribution. Consider America&#x2019;s economic recovery in 2009&#x2013;2010. Overall incomes in that period grew by 2.3 percent&#x2014;tepid growth, to be sure, but a lot stronger than you might have guessed from the general gloom of that period.</p><p>Look more closely at the data, though, as economist Emmanuel Saez did, and it turns out that average Americans were right to doubt the economic comeback. That&#x2019;s because for 99 percent of Americans, incomes increased by a mere 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, the incomes of the top 1 percent jumped by 11.6 percent. It was definitely a recovery&#x2014;for the 1 percent.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a similar story behind the boom in the emerging markets. The &#x201c;India Shining&#x201d; of the urban middle class has left unt...</p></p><h2>Women Beyond the Wire</h2><p>NO highlighting or underlining. Some wear but overall very good condition.

No subject is safe: Bosnia, Norman Mailer, Helen Mirren, Hitler--and yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lively and smart, angry and thoughtful, and a perfect companion to his bestselling <i>Arguably</i>, <i>And Yet, And Yet</i> is classic Christopher Hitchens. It will delight fans and critics alike.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2015:</strong> What a tragic irony that in this era of surreptitious videotaping, political posturing and runaway media, we no longer have the brilliant Christopher Hitchens to decipher it all for us. The award-winning essayist (many say &#x201c;polemicist&#x201d; and mean it as a compliment) died of esophageal cancer in 2011. But if we can only speculate as to what Hitchens would have to say about the world in 2015, we at least can read these collected essays, some already published, some not &#x2013; at his death, it is said that he left nearly 250,000 words of as-yet-unpublished essays. Whether old or new to us, the pieces collected here are funny and wry and searingly intelligent; not a single nuance or nanosecond of phoniness slips by &#x201c;Hitch.&#x201d; Whether analyzing the romanticization of revered Cuban revolutionary leader Che Guevara, or remarking that the conservative pundit Pat Buchanan is a &#x201c;faux bonhomme,&#x201d; Hitchens quietly astounds us still with his characteristic combination of erudition and commonality. Reading Hitchens was always a wry, witty pleasure; now that he&#x2019;s gone, it&#x2019;s more like having a wonderful dream, a nocturnal visit from a beloved, brilliant friend. --<em>Sara Nelson</em></p>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS was a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and authored numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and George Orwell. He was also the author of the international bestsellers <i>God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, Hitch-22: A Memoir</i>, and, most recently, <i>Arguably: Essays</i>. He died in December 2011.</p><h2>Selma to Saigon: The Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War (Civil Rights and Struggle)</h2><p>The civil rights and anti&#x2013;Vietnam War movements were the two greatest protests of twentieth-century America. The dramatic escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam in 1965 took precedence over civil rights legislation, which had dominated White House and congressional attention during the first half of the decade. The two issues became intertwined on January 6, 1966, when the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) became the first civil rights organization to formally oppose the war, protesting the injustice of drafting African Americans to fight for the freedom of the South Vietnamese people when they were still denied basic freedoms at home.<br><br><i>Selma to Saigon</i> explores the impact of the Vietnam War on the national civil rights movement. Before the war gained widespread attention, the New Left, the SNCC, and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) worked together to create a biracial alliance with the potential to make significant political and social gains in Washington. Contention over the war, however, exacerbated preexisting generational and ideological tensions that undermined the coalition, and Lucks analyzes the causes and consequences of this disintegration. <br><br>This powerful narrative illuminates the effects of the Vietnam War on the lives of leaders such as Whitney Young Jr., Stokely Carmichael, Roy Wilkins, Bayard Rustin, and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as other activists who faced the threat of the military draft along with race-related discrimination and violence. Providing new insights into the evolution of the civil rights movement, this book fills a significant gap in the literature about one of the most tumultuous periods in American history.</p><p><b>Daniel S. Lucks</b> earned his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley."The first full-length treatment of the relationship between the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War, this extremely well-researched and very readable book should become the standard in its area."&#x2015;James E. Westheider, author of <i>The African American Experience in Vietnam: Brothers In Arms</i><p>"While many others have examined the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, no one, to date, has presented as well-researched and well-written examination of the relationship between these two seminal developments as Lucks does in <i>Selma to Saigon</i>. Lucks convincingly argues that the war forced African Americans to 'choose sides' and that by the end of the 1960s the civil rights movement had become yet another casualty of the fight in Southeast Asia. His work should be of interest to a broad range of readers, from scholars of the civil rights movement to a more general audience of readers interested in the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the 1960s."&#x2015;Peter B. Levy, author of<i> Civil War on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland</i></p><p>"At last, a book that acknowledges the enormous impact of the Cold War on the relationship between the civil rights and peace movements. Reading Daniel Lucks's analysis of how the Vietnam War divided the civil rights movement, one cannot help but consider the profound and lasting consequences of those divisions and the lessons we might learn as we continue the struggle for justice and peace."&#x2015;Robbie Lieberman, author of <i>The Strangest Dream: Communism, Anticommunism and the U.S. Peace Movement 1945-1963</i></p><p>"In <i>Selma to Saigon</i>, Daniel S. Lucks places civil rights leaders' responses to the Vietnam War firmly within the Cold War context, and explores the tragic repercussions of America's disastrous military intervention in Southeast Asia for African Americans. His important book demonstrates the continuing draw of 'The Sixties' on the historical imagination, as well as that turbulent era's complex legacy."&#x2015;Simon Hall, author of <i>Peace and Freedom: The Civil Rights and Antiwar Movements in the 1960s</i></p><p>"A pivotal and much-needed examination of the impact of the war in Vietnam on black America and the civil rights movement. Few wars produced as many ironies and paradoxes, as Lucks demonstrates compellingly and thoughtfully in his analysis and through the voices and actions of the participants, one of whom said, 'I had left one war and came back to fight another one.' That spirit resonated among many who survived and returned to a changed and all-too-familiar America."&#x2015;Leon F. Litwack, A. F. and May T.

[] Based on meticulous research of a wide array of sources, Lucks paints an intense picture of the Vietnam War's effects on the civil rights movement and Lyndon B. Johnson's civil rights activism."&#x2015;<i>H-Net Reviews</i></p><p>"Daniel S. Lucks's comprehensive and compelling <i>Selma to Saigon </i>carefully examines how the U.S. war in Vietnam affected the course of the civil rights struggle.</p><p></p><p>It is the volume's rigorous detail in the telling that makes this work so valuable. Lucks combines a rich store of notable quotations and figures, historiographical insights, prominent tales told elsewhere, and original archival contributions to create a dense chronology that provides illuminating context for the actions taken by movement actors.</p><p></p><p>For students of these critical social movements and for those seeking to understand the complex political and ideological currents that buoy and sink struggles for social change, <i>Selma to Saigon </i>is an outstanding and welcome resource."&#x2015;<i>Journal of American History</i></p><p>"Luck's <i>Selma to Saigon</i> is a powerful study that illustrates how the Vietnam War affected the lives and decisions of both famous and little-known civil rights leaders as they decided to challenge the reasons for US expansion of its involvement in the Vietnam War. More importantly, however, this well-researched and skillfully written book makes a very important and potent contribution to the growing literature on the history of the civil rights movement from a more global perspective."&#x2015;<i>Historian</i></p><p>"In <i>Selma to Saigon</i>, Lucks has provided a thoroughly researched work of historiography indispensable to African American Studies, Civil Rights, American history, and social movement scholars. By situating his analysis in the deep Cold War context and its long thaw through the 1960s, he offers a nuance to our understanding of the eventual disintegration of the Civil Rights coalition, while filling a necessary gap in the enormity of Civil Rights literature."&#x2015;<i>Journal of American Culture</i></p><p>"...quite unlike many other similar works, this [book] explores a period of African American history when the walls of twentieth-century Jim Crow America literally did "come tumbling down." ...the author, without fanfare and exaggeration, gives readers a broad and interior look at how an unprecedented cast of talented African American leaders grappled with two of the most turbulent developments in American history since the Civil War and Reconstruction: civil rights and the Vietnam War... the book gives readers one of the most riveting glimpses available on major civil rights leaders as they twisted ideologically between the poles of their own pangs of conscience and the hated labels assigned to those who opposed Cold War orthodoxy or the pioneering civil rights leadership of President Johnson."&#x2015;David Dennard, <i>The Journal of African American History</i></p></p><h2>A Wodehouse Bestiary</h2><p>Fourteen comic tales dealing with the relationships between humans and their animals have been selected and compiled from the works of the great British humorist</p><p>D.

What comes across strongly is his candour and honesty, traits which are increasingly rare in the world of the martial arts, and his willingness to protest against unethical behaviour and injustices. It is fascinating to peer into another life - providing one can learn something - and one can do so from his largely autobiographical Martial Musings. Read it! It will be to your advantage." ~ Richard Bowen, Vice-President, The Budokwai </p><p>"Without doubt a rara avis in the budo world, where glamour and a fast buck appear to be in the ascendancy and reasonableness and quiet passion are practically non-existent." ~ Paul Nurse, judoka </p><p>"I heartily endorse R. W. Smith's new book . . . a big informative book on these arts, telling the stories of those men and women populating them." ~ Henri Ple, 10th-dan karate, 5th-dan judo </p><p>No doubt, you will find Martial Musings insightful and enjoyable reading. Robert W. Smith, a pioneer in Asian martial arts research in America with thirteen previously published books, shares more than fifty years experience in martial arts practice and research. Based on reflections on the people and places that shaped martial arts in the 20th century, the book's topics include: </p><p>- an array of martial art styles<br> - profiles of leading personalities<br> - geographic hotbeds of martial arts <br> - and more!</p>Robert W. Smith may be known as a world's leading authority on Asian martial arts, but this book shows he is much more than that. His pioneering work in the field has inspired others to follow, but perhaps none have brought such drive, stamina, and scholarly skills to such a monumental task. <p>Smith has practiced, taught, and written on the Asian martial arts for more than fifty years. From his late teens he trained under eminent Western boxing and wrestling coaches and later immersed himself in judo and finally the Chinese martial arts under celebrated masters. He taught many students in the latter arts in the Washington D.C. area where he worked as an intelligence officer for the Central Intelligence Agency. </p><p>Martial Musings records insightful details associated with Smith's years of involvement with combatives in the U.S. and overseas. But, what makes this book such a joy to devour is the literary relish Smith stir-fries in with the book's basic ingredients. He astutely couples combatives with literary panache, and a ready wit.</p></p><h2>Mine!</h2><p>Have you ever had a toy you really really liked? &nbsp;Have you ever had a <i>lot</i> of toys you really really liked?<br><br>Have you ever said "MINE!"?<br><br>If so, this book is for you!<br><br>Enjoy this adorable, playful, picture-based book about two very young children and an adorable dog navigating the troubles and triumphs of sharing, now available in a board book edition.</p><p>SHUTTA CRUM is the author of many picture books and novels for young readers, including <i>The Bravest of the Brave</i>, illustrated by Tim Bowers, and Thomas and the Dragon Queen.<b>NYTimes.com, August 17, 2011:</b><br>"[A] delightful example of the drama and emotion that a nearly wordless book can convey...the laughter of young readers will doubtlessly round out the narrative."<br><b><br>Starred Review, Publishers Weekly, April 18, 2011:</b><br>"Crum uses only the title word (if you don't count a single "Woof?"), but the various inflections speak volumes about the comic dynamics of sharing...[Barton's] dizzyingly expressive digitized pencil sketches seem to be everywhere at once continually reframing the action to make sure readers savor every gleefully anarchic moment."<br><br><b>Starred Review, Kirkus Reviews, May 15, 2011:</b><br>"The capricious artwork has touches of Helen Oxenbury and Marla Frazee&#x2019;s babies, smudgy, digitized pencil sketches full of movement and joy...This charming, animated episode will elicit giggles and demands of 'read it again!<i>'"<br><br></i><b>Starred Review, School Library Journal, June 2011:</b><br>"The two youngsters are simply adorable, and their alternating surprised and gleeful expressions, as well as those of their canine accomplice, are priceless.

Wells</p><p><p>Rebecca West&nbsp;(1892&#x2013;1983) was a novelist, biographer, journalist, and critic. She published eight novels in addition to her masterpiece&nbsp;<i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i>, for which she made several trips to the Balkans. Following World War II, West also published two books on the relation of the individual to the state, called&nbsp;<i>The Meaning of Treason</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Train of Powder</i>.&nbsp;</p>Perhaps understandably, the distinguished novelist, journalist and woman-of-letters never completed this novel she wrote in the 1920s, an outright roman a clef based on her affairs with H. G. Wells and the newspaper tycoon Lord Beaverbrook. Sunflower is the name of the central character, a beautiful, rich actress externally unlike her creator but internally similar in some interesting ways, as Dame Rebecca's authorized biographer Victoria Glendinning makes wonderfully clear in an illuminating afterword. Sunflower's long affair with the Wells character, Lord Essingtona scandal in its time that only an avowed feminist of West's courage would darehad run its course. In its wake she forms a relationship with Francis Pitt (as West did with Beaverbrook), a most unsatisfactory liaison. The powerful public woman was deep within an "eternally feminine" one desiring marriage and family, home and security. Sunflower enacts these deep wishes, longing for what she cannot attain. As the affairs resolved nothing in life, the author entered psychoanalysis, and one can speculate that the novel's incompletion had much to do with her basic irresolution. As fiction, this is not altogether satisfactory, but it is nonetheless a striking study in the relation of art and life, autobiography and imagination, fact and fantasy. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tim Burton: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)</h2><p><p>Starting his career as an animator for Disney, Tim Burton made his feature film directorial debut with the visually dazzling, low-budget <i>Pee-Wee's Big Adventure</i>.

By the time your feet hit the floor, you feel burdened, irritated, sluggish, and downright miserable-especially on workdays. No wonder they call it "daybreak"-you feel shattered even before you begin. <br> <br>Where are those moments like on the television commercials where a fresh-looking person with a joyful smile laced with morning sunshine lifts themselves luxuriously from the bed with an expression of bliss? <br> <br>That moment isn't in a product. <br>It can't be bottled, jarred, or shrink-wrapped. <br>It isn't stuffed in your mattress or pillow, or woven in your sheets. <br>That moment is actually in you. <br> <br>If your mind is clouded upon waking with all the tasks you must comthis day, then the reality you've set before yourself will be tiresome, long, and filled with stress. If, however, you turn that first moment of magick into a thought of positive power-what then? How do you think your day will unfold? <br> <br>Meditation, generally thought of as an esoteric, New Age practice for the elite few who can sit with their backs straight and legs in a perfect lotus position for hours on end, is simply an elongated thought turned into an enchantment. It is more than a tool for self-knowledge and self-improvethough it is those things too; what we are going to focus on here is how it is a tool for daily living that can change your life and assist you in manifesting whatever you want and living the life you really want. And anycan master the techniques to make dreams into reality. <br> <br><b>MindLight Meditation <br> <br></b>Right now-this minute-I want you to put this book down and prop it so that your hands are free, but you can read along with me. Are you situated? Good! <br> <br>Position your hands as if you are holding a small ball of glowwhite light. Take your time. Just relax and build the light between your hands. This light is a part of you and a part of the Great Work: what you will accomplish for the good of others throughout your lifetime. The light is a tool that you can use to build a healthy, positive future-and the most remarkable aspect is that this tremendous power lies in you! <br> <br>Next, move your hands apart and together as if they are held by a giant rubber band. Open, close, open, close. Keep playing with the light and, as you do so, remember what it is like to move your hands through water-nice and slow, with a gentle, flowing resistance, except here we translate that feeling through watery resistance as elasticity. <br> <br>Add this remembered feeling of what it is like to move your hands through water to the present movement of your hands working with the MindLight-in, out, in, out. Try not to go past your shoulders when you move out, because we are workon building (we don't want to scatter). <br> <br>Keep the rubber-band motion of your hands moving in and out shoulder-width apart, then move in for the compact ball of light, and out again. Repeat. Think of nothing but the light in your hands. If you begin to worry about other things, just gently push the thoughts away. Concentrate only on the ball of light. Stay in the moment. <br> <br>Now we add the sacred breath. As you inhale with nice, deep breaths, draw your hands together to make the small ball. As you move your hands out and away from each other, exhale with one smooth, even breath. Inhale (hands in)-exhale (hands out). The slower the better. Techniques learned at a nice, slow pace stay with you longer and will be more precise when you need the power. <br> <br>Rather than dwelling on a specific problem at the moment, let's choose an energy that encourages openness of opportunity. What do you want the most right now: Peace? Harmony? Creativity? Wisdom? Happiness? Healing? Choose one of these and say the word aloud. <br> <br>Now, look into the MindLight you hold in your hands and take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Do this at least three times-more if you are stressed or unhappy. <br> <br>Now, breathe fully from the diaphragm and then inhale from the chest. Practice this type of breathing with several cleansing breaths, and when you are ready, take three of these nice, deep, measured breaths. <br> <br>On the third time, blow your desire (peace, harmony, creativwisdom, happiness, healing, etc.) into the MindLight. That's right, just pucker up those beautiful lips of yours and send that thought easily, fluidly into the MindLight you've created. Let the breath carrying your desire flow across your lips like fine silk through your fingers-the moisture from your body digitized by your thoughts of perfection. Once the thought is in the ball between your hands, you may feel the seemingly empty space vibrate, or your hands may tingle, or you might feel a "lightness" throughout your body. <br> <br>Pull your hands (holding the light ball) in over your heart, allowyour body to drink in this lovely MindLight you created. <br> <br>Breathe deeply several times, and as you breath in, think of your heart being surrounded by this harmonious, vibrant light. As you exhale, continue to relax and let go of any pent-up negativity-old hurts, pain, fear, unhappiness, etc. Every time you inhale, allow the light within yourself to grow stronger and brighter. Every time you exhale, let go of more and more crusted up, gross mental garbage. Let the negativity break away, piece by piece. Keep up this visualization as long as you can; there is no time requirement. <br>When you feel you are finished for now, drop your hands to your lap, close your eyes, and take another deep, even breath. Open your eyes and pick up the book. Don't you feel great? <br> <br>You've just learned two very valuable pieces of information-the benof deep, cleansing breathing and how to create a MindLight. Tomormorning, when you wake up, don't allow yourself to think of anything except that MindLight you just created. Was it for peace? Wisdom? HappiSay the word you associated in your mind with the MindLight several times as you rise to consciousness, eyelids slightly fluttering as you emerge to greet the day. Push all other thoughts aside-every single one. Just keep the word in your mind as you get up and begin the movements of meetyour day. Again, don't line up those tasks like little marching soldiers of personal duty. Instead, put that MindLight in your cup. That's right, let the MindLight of happiness, positive self-worth, peace, or creativity (whatever you called it) sink slowly into that steaming cup of coffee or chilled juice. Drink it. Say to yourself, "I will meet every task as I should. The day will progress with plenty of time to achieve all I desire, and I will feel energized, positive, and useful until I go to sleep tonight." Now, go about your day. Throughout the day, should you become stressed or overburdened, think of your MindLight like a fun bouncing ball. Be in the moment with that MindLight ball. Re-create the light in your hands when you are particustressed. Remember to breathe deeply and slowly. See your MindLight dancing on the boss's head when he's acting pushy because he's majorly stressed. Or over there at the screaming cab driver. Or under the dining room table tickling your son's feet (you know, the kid who is throwing the tantrum?). Bet you'll be surprised at what happens! <br> <br>Meditation is nothing more than the moment you make magick. <br> <br>Meditation is the wizard of the mind. <br> <br>And the next night? Make a new MindLight, just like the first one. It can have the same theme or a different one. Then, when you wake up the folmorning, repeat the sequence-don't think of anything except that bouncing, lively MindLight the first few minutes of the day. Continue to play with that MindLight all day and evening long. <br> <br>Remember to stay in the moment with your new mind tool. <br> <br>And if you make MindLights all week? <br> <br>Expect your life to change and welcome it. You've just learned how to change your life in a positive way with very little effort-and now you know precisely what it is to meditate. <br> <br>Meditation is the still point of unlimited opportunity. <br> <br><b>Friday Night Fights! <br> <br></b>We're standing on a big, well-lit canvas square flanked by ropes secured at the four corners by metal poles. Already we can smell the sweat and heat of human bodies mixed with the aroma of popcorn and hot dogs, stale beer and flat soda. You are surrounded by loud music and people laughing in a swirl of popping, glaring lights and you move your feet a little bit-darned shoes are too tight, they're pinching, and so you add this tidbit of irritation to your experience of "too much input"! The electric anticipation in the atmosphere flicks at your temples like a cat's whiskers before the clawed strike, so vividly that you think you can reach out and touch that energy, and for a moment, you ride a high as never before. Like the air you breathe, you can't see the charged energy, but you know that it's there. Suddenly, the crowd leaps to its collective feet, screaming and shouting, roaring into a combined beast of amazing power while a simultaneous clanging of bells heralds the beginning of the event in a cacophony of heady vibration . . . darn those shoes anyway! <br> <br>And in the background, like a voice echoing in a rinsed-out soup can, you hear, "Are you ready to rrr-rumble!?" <br> <br>Welcome to your life. <br> <br>Every day we wrestle with the cause and effect of our own actions, which are a physical manifestation of our thoughts. Like the Friday night fights, we show up in the ring, prepared or not, to put on the gloves and duke it out with our problems, frustrations, fears, and personal foibles, now and then riding a whirlwind high that makes it all seem somehow worthOn occasion we celebrate a marvelous TKO and other times we hit the mat in head-crunching pain, only to rise again in the final count. Now and then, the fight is a draw and we save it for another day, when perhaps the stars and our brains are more in our favor. We are successful when we've managed to heal ourselves to the point of acceptable re-entry into that big ring of life where we will fight courageously to obtain the world champion prize: ourselves. <br> <br>The blood, violence, and gore of fight night a little too blatant for you in a book that's supposed to be about spirituality? That's the point! We are physical people in a rough and tumble, hard-core world trying to put the proverbial square peg of reality as we built it in the round hole of spiritualas we wish to perceive it. What doesn't help is that we create the reality we know based on a self-conditioning that often gives our power away to the roaring crowds around us and pinches us uncomfortably just to remind us that we are still living (like those shoes that are a bit too tight). <br> <br>Several years ago when I was on tour for one of my books I carried a drum with me. Part of every seminar was to have the participants, five or ten at a time, scream the following into the open end of the drum: "I take back my power!" And as each group stepped up to the plate of change, I encouraged the crowd to become a cheering squad (everyone needs a little helping hand once in a while). The results were astounding. People left the seminar smiling, joyful, feeling very good about themselves. Later, I would receive letters and e-mails about how much their lives had changed in a positive way. Why did this change occur? Because for at least a second or two they had collected and solidified the courage to create their own realat the top of its game, to send out a message to themselves and others that they had aligned their energies to create a wholesome self in control of their own destiny. Right then, right there, they stayed in the moment of power and change with the help of the cheering crowd, their very support obliterating fears and worries of the past. <br> <br>Did it last, that feeling of power within themselves? Yes, for a few who went on to make positive, radical changes in their lives-for those people that seminar was the tipping point to success. Whether they knew it or not, they'd been preparing themselves for a positive change for quite some time. What about the others-those who did not go on to the success that they desired? Was there something wrong with them? Actually, no. Due to past self-conditioning, they simply weren't in agreement with themselves to let go of the negativity in their lives long enough to move forward-and, in most cases, probably because they were bored stiff with life in general. <br> <br>And there's the rub. For many of us think we've seen it all, heard it all, done it all to the point where we are so unbelievably bored that we continue to seek the addictions of our old emotions to keep us feeling like we're still in the game of life-like we're still a major player, no matter what field the game is commencing on. We've created a pattern that "sort of" works for us, so in lieu of anything better, we keep dragging out the same pattern, brushit off and twisting it in new ways in hopes that it will work better for us. The problem with this scenario is that once you've hit the critical first-time high with any pattern, every time thereafter gives us a little less adrenaline rush, and a little less, and a little less, until most crises play themselves out due to our own invariable boredom. Ever meet a person whose life is one continuing drama after another? It's because they're bored stiff and each new action-packed psychological scenario loosens up the joints for a little bit so they don't remain under the Medusa's spell conjured directly by themselves in the first place. How many of you agree? Raise your hand. Mine's up first because I've done this to myself innumerable times. How about you? <br> <br>Before I write any book (and I think this is number nineteen) I always go to various bookstores to see what's happening in the genre I've chosen. Then I look at other genres to see what seems to be in vogue there. Since I wanted to write a book on meditation, I found myself all over the darned place. Granted, I wrote a great deal about how to meditate in my book To Stir a Magick Cauldron several years ago, and this book has sold over 300,000 copies, but now I wanted to approach the subject in a different, more simand active way. What were other authors currently producing on this subject? My bookstore jaunt showed that some meditation books were in the religious studies section, some were in the occult section (or whatever they're calling it this season), others were in self-help, and still more could be found in the new, flashy, huge motivational section. In all, I found only about five titles in the whole store that dealt specifically with meditation. Why, I wondered, would such a terrific tool for self-empowerment have such minute appeal? Well, because it's boring, that's why. Meditation hit its tipping point back in the early 70s-it reached its level of saturation, and the world (most of it) moved on. Why? Because it is like everything else. We learn how to do it and then we lose interest. It no longer gives us the emotional high we first experienced. Motivational books are the same way, and frankly, this is how any fad begins.

Although it was almost dark he could still see the high wall running along the left-hand side of the street. The flickering glow of a torch lit the nearest stretch of brickwork. On his right, the palace rooftops loomed black against the frozen sky. Two servants came out of the shadows, walking into the palace. One caught his eye but did not acknowledge him. Three weeks had passed since he had come to court, supposedly to finish his education, and already he was regretting his father's decision.</p> <p>He rubbed his hands together, and blew on them. Tucking his fingers under his arms for warmth, he ran the toe of his shoe over the smooth surface of a small patch of ice. The air smelled of frozen earth, with traces of burning pitch from the torch. He felt hungry as well as cold. When he was older he would buy himself some gloves, he vowed, and never have to stand with such chilled fingers again.</p> <p>He started to walk across the width of the gatehouse, whistling snatches of a tune he remembered his mother singing. He wondered if his parents were well. He thought of them talking about him back home in the village-about how proud they were that he was in the queen's service at Whitehall. That image sweetened him and saddened him at the same time, for he knew how shocked they would be if they could see the way he was treated. Dick Venner regularly shouted at him as if he were his master, even though Dick was only a year older. It was Dick who was responsible for teaching him the ways of the court, and it was Dick who had beaten him with a wooden rod when he did not bow low enough to a Polish nobleman.</p> <p>The sound of horses approaching at speed broke into his reverie. A moment later he saw their shapes come out of the darkness. There were four of them, their eyes great black beads in the torchlight, their heads glistening with sweat. Two men dismounted, both out of breath; one took the reins of his own horse and those of the other man. The latter was short and thin. The boy noticed the fine cut of his clothes; but even by torchlight he could see that the riding cloak was splattered with mud, the black silk doublet beneath it similarly besmottered. The man had a crease between his eyes so that it seemed like he was permanently frowning. His head was covered by a black skull cap-but he was not that old, only in his midthirties. He seemed distant from his companions. The two who remained mounted bade him farewell and departed; his companion led the two horses away to the stables.</p> <p>"Boy, take me to Sir William," the man said between short breaths.</p> <p>Sir William. One of the first things that Dick Venner had taught him was that there was only one "Sir William." Other men might be called "Sir William this" or "Sir William that"-but there was only one plain "Sir William." He was Sir William Cecil, the queen's Principal Secretary, and the most powerful man in the government: in fact, the most powerful man in the whole kingdom. He was also reputed to be the most intelligent. Normally the boy would not have known where Sir William was, but on this occasion he did. Sir William had rushed to court two days ago, when terrible news had arrived from Scotland. The rumor among the other boys was that Lord Henry Stewart was dead. Many messages had been delivered since then-one almost every hour. Sir William had barely left the queen's side in all that time.</p> <p>The boy bowed politely. "With all respect for your lordship, Sir William has given instructions that he is not to be disturbed, except for messengers coming from Sir William Drury."</p> <p>The small man with the skull cap looked directly at him. "Do you not know who I am?"</p> <p>The boy stood firm, though inside he was quaking. "No, my lord."</p> <p>"My name is Francis Walsingham. Sir William is my patron. I have news for him that will turn his hair gray. Now..." Walsingham reached forward and grabbed the boy's ear in his right hand and twisted it. "Take me to him, without delay."</p> <p>"Mr. Walsingham, sir, he has already received the news about the Scottish-"</p> <p>"TAKE ME TO HIM!" shouted Walsingham, pushing him toward the side door that led through into the privy palace.</p> <p>Tears came to the boy's eyes, but he blinked them back as he led the way along the covered corridor behind the Lord Chamberlain's house. The route took them into a whitewashed corridor, through another door, out into the cold night again, and along a path between the mass of irregular buildings that formed part of the old palace. They passed the busy figures of servants, gentlemen, cooks, and clerks in the near darkness. In some places torches lit the route. Where it was dark, he felt his way, running his hand along the wall. He led Walsingham through to the great court and along one side of it, and under an arch into the stone gallery that ran between the privy palace and the privy garden. Finally, after hearing the heels of Walsingham's nailed boots ringing out behind him against the flagstones of the gallery for about fifty yards, he came to the entrance, lit by a wall-mounted metal lantern. He took the ring of the door handle, turned it, and entered, and after closing it again behind the visitor, went up a flight of stairs to the first of a series of antechambers.</p> <p>He had expected to see two guards here, men who should have been on duty outside the closed door to the privy palace. But there was no one. He turned to Walsingham to explain that he was not allowed beyond this door.</p> <p>"Open it," snapped Walsingham before he could speak. The boy turned the handle and pushed the door open.</p> <p>The chamber had large gilded beams in the high ceiling, with red and blue painted decoration between them. The colors were clearly visible in the light of six burning candles that hung in the center of the room. There were warming tapestries too, the figures on them like mysterious onlookers from the shadows. A fire was burning on a hearth-but there was no one to be seen.</p> <p>"Lead on," ordered Walsingham, his boots thudding on the floorboards.</p> <p>At that moment the door at the far end of the chamber opened and a man in purple ecclesiastical vestments entered. He looked surprised to see them.</p> <p>"Your Grace," said Walsingham, bowing. The boy also bowed low.</p> <p>"Walsingham, you cannot go in," said the bishop in a deep voice. "The queen and Sir William will not be disturbed. Besides..." He looked down at Walsingham's mud-spattered clothes and filthy shirt, "her majesty will not approve of your apparel."</p> <p>"I am not looking for her approval. Sir William will not forgive me if I delay."</p> <p>"But will the queen?" The bishop looked Walsingham in the eye. "Never mind. If it concerns Lord Henry Stewart, you're too late. They've already heard it. Drury has been sending letters at regular intervals, and others have hastened here directly from the north."</p> <p>"My news is of quite another order. But what is this about Lord Henry? I have been away."</p> <p>"A sorry tale, but one that I fear was inevitable. He has been murdered-killed in the grounds of his house at Edinburgh. No one knows who is guilty and it seems the Scots queen has not arrested anyone, which leaves the finger of blame pointing at the lady herself." </p> <p>The boy looked at Walsingham. The crease between his eyes seemed even deeper.</p> <p>"Then I have all the more reason to speak to Sir William immediately," he said.</p> <p>"I have already told you-"</p> <p>"Lead on," commanded Walsingham, putting his hand on the boy's shoulder. "Thank you for your information, my Lord Bishop; thank you."</p> <p>He pushed the boy toward the oak door, and went through to the next antechamber. This was better lit. More tapestries, another hearth, a servant piling fresh logs on the embers. The beams were similarly gilded, with deep blue azurite decoration and stars in the depicted firmament. Two gentlemen ushers were at the far end. One was doing the rounds, lighting candles; the other was listening at the door. The one at the door turned, alarmed, when he heard Walsingham enter.</p> <p>"Do you have nothing else to do?" asked Walsingham, his voice self-consciously loud. "Get you hence!"</p> <p>The usher, astonished at Walsingham's arrogance, moved and Walsingham boldly marched up to the door and opened it. The boy stood back, nervous about intruding on the royal presence. He wanted to return to his cold station at the gate but Walsingham grabbed the scruff of his doublet and steered him through into the queen's great chamber.</p> <p>It was a huge room, with a high, gilded ceiling and wide, gilded walls, as large as any room the boy had ever seen: as big as the largest great hall known to him. He wanted to look up and gaze at the spectacle, for the whole room seemed to be encased in gold, but his attention was commanded by the sudden lack of noise. More than thirty men were here, standing or sitting, and the talk had died abruptly. They all looked at Walsingham. Some were gentlemen and knights of the royal household; others were lords and courtiers identifiable as such by their lavish silk and satin doublets, fine ruffs, and embroidered hosen. Two or three men were wearing gowns, being men of the law or of the Church.</p> <p>Walsingham did not stop but kept walking, still pushing the reluctant boy before him. Two men-at-arms looked startled, uncertain whether to stop them.</p> <p>"Announce me," he said loudly. To a man-at-arms he ordered, "Open the door."</p> <p>"Do you realize what you are doing?" called a man's voice nearby. Another shouted, "Show some respect!" A third man stepped in front of Walsingham and told him, "You cannot do this, Walsingham. We are all waiting our turn." A fourth man added, "The queen is with Sir William; she does not want to be disturbed."</p> <p>A tall, exquisitely dressed lord approached; he was wearing a black velvet cape embroidered with gold and silver thread. "Look at the state of you, Walsingham," he chided. "For your own good, I suggest-"</p> <p>"For your own good, my Lord Chamberlain, be out of my way," retorted Walsingham, pushing past those who stood between him and the next door.</p> <p>"For your own good, you are still wearing your sword," snapped back the Lord Chamberlain, his eyes meeting Walsingham's.</p> <p>Walsingham stopped, unbuckled his sword, and without a word, thrust it at the boy. Then, staring at the Lord Chamberlain, he spoke to the boy. "Go through that door and announce me. Now!" Again he ordered the guards, "Open those doors."</p> <p>The guards looked at one another. One nodded. Together they opened the doors. The boy, scarcely able to control his nervousness, handed Walsingham's sword to one of them, who accepted it without a word. Then he tiptoed into the queen's chamber, with Walsingham hard behind him.</p> <p>The room was dark and vast, almost as large as the great chamber, with just two points of light in the far corner. The boy found himself moving as if in a dream, entranced by the strange riches around him and the sense of being in a forbidden place, as if he were in Heaven or the Underworld. He wondered whether it was treason to enter the queen's presence without permission. He feared it was. Maybe he would be sent away in disgrace. A chamber clock chimed the sixth hour and he stopped outside; a great bell also chimed six times.</p> <p>The two lights were a pair of candles on a standing iron frame beside the glowing fire. He could see two figures: a seated woman in a scarlet-colored gown, and a slightly portly gentleman who moved uneasily across the line of light. The boy was halted in his tracks by the man's voice.</p> <p>"Who the devil comes here at this time? Who are you who dares come in here?"</p> <p>The echo of the voice died away.</p> <p>"Announce me," hissed Walsingham.</p> <p>"My lord, your Royal Majesty," said the boy, who had never been allowed anywhere near the queen before, and had never been told how to address her or her Secretary. His courage failed him. He faltered, and fell silent. Dick Venner had advised him that, "If you see the queen, bury your forehead in the ground." He now followed that advice, and went down on both knees, and spoke to the floor. "Your Grace," he began, not knowing how to address a man more important than a bishop, "this is Mr. Walsingham, who...who comes on urgent business."</p> <p>Walsingham stepped forward. "I would speak with you alone, Sir William."</p> <p>The boy could not believe what he had just heard. Even though he knew little about etiquette, he understood that Walsingham had just shown huge disrespect to the queen. He heard a rustle of silk skirts and slow footsteps. He dared not move but remained pressed to the floor.</p> <p>"What did you say?" said the queen. Her voice was that of a young woman but more clipped, controlled. The boy sensed Walsingham slowly go down on his knees.</p> <p>"Your Majesty."</p> <p>"Tell me, Mr. Walsingham, what business brings you here to speak to our Secretary who is with us in a private audience? We are conscious of your lack of tact, which is sadly habitual. We are all too well aware of your rudeness and your clumsiness of manner, but no matter what you think you are doing, we still expect you to act like a gentleman. Speak, or we will have you whipped out of this room."</p> <p>The boy did not dare to move. He hoped the queen would overlook his presence. Maybe he could slide away when Walsingham left without her even noticing him?</p> <p>"Your Majesty," said Walsingham, "given that I must speak, and urgently, would you permit me to tell Sir William the grave news-that Clarenceux is dead."</p> <p>The queen turned to Cecil. "Clarenceux King of Arms? Is that news sufficient to disturb us?" She turned back to Walsingham. "Do you not realize the gravity of the situation? A prince of the royal blood has been murdered. Lord Henry Stewart might have been a drinker and a philanderer, not to mention a stupid young man, but he was of the royal blood, and now he is dead, killed by whom we know not. What is the death of a herald in comparison? Are you going to interrupt my privy meeting to tell me one of my cooks has died?"</p> <p>She glared at him. Walsingham met her gaze, then bowed his head.

(I try to act in the gap between the two.)" &#x2015;Robert Rauschenberg</strong></p><p>The early 1950s, when Robert Rauschenberg launched his career, was the heyday of the heroic gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Rauschenberg challenged this tradition, inventing new interdisciplinary models of artistic practice that shaped the decades to come. Published in conjunction with this century's first retrospective of this defining figure in postwar art, this richly illustrated catalog reframes Rauschenberg&#x2019;s widely celebrated <i>Combines</i> (1954&#x2013;64) and silkscreen paintings (1962&#x2013;64) in fresh ways. It also illuminates lesser-known periods within Rauschenberg&#x2019;s career, including his work of the early 1950s and that from the late 1960s onward, now compelling and prescient to contemporary eyes.<br><br>Sixteen short essays by eminent scholars and emerging new writers focus on specific moments throughout Rauschenberg&#x2019;s career, exploring his creative production across an extraordinary range of media and following him on his travels around the globe. Integrating new scholarship, documentary imagery and archival materials, <i>Robert Rauschenberg</i> is the first comprehensive catalogue of the artist&#x2019;s career in 20 years, an important contribution to American cultural and intellectual history and a necessary volume for anyone interested in contemporary art.</p><p>Over the span of six decades, <b>Robert Rauschenberg</b> (1925&#x2013;2008) worked in an astonishing range of mediums including painting, sculpture, prints, photography and performance. Working alone and in collaboration with artists, dancers, musicians and writers, Rauschenberg produced a vast body of work that set the course for art of the present day.</p></p><p>An essential volume on the work of Robert Rauschenberg, this relevatory selection of rarely seen masterworks is curated in collaboration with the artist s estate and includes an extensive chronology. In a career of nearly sixty years, Robert Rauschenberg changed the course of art history, art making, and viewers&#39; experience of art. An artist of protean creativity, he transformed the mediums of sculpture, painting, prints, and photography. He elevated seemingly casual, everyday images and embraced discarded and found materials, reintroducing content to art after decades when abstraction held sway.<p><b>Leah Dickerman</b> is Director of Editorial &amp; Content Strategy at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><p><b>Achim Borchardt-Hume</b> is Director of Exhibitions at Tate Modern, London.</p><p><b>Yve-Alain Bois</b> is Professor of Art History at the School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University.</p><p><b>Andrianna Campbell</b>is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Art History at the CUNY Graduate Center, where she specializes in American art in the modern and contemporary period.</p><p><b>Hal Foster</b> is American art critic and historian.</p><p><b>Mark Godfrey</b> is Curator of Contemporary Art at Tate Modern, London.</p><p><b>Hiroko Ikegami</b> is Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Intercultural Studies at Kobe University and specializes in post-1945 American art and its global impact.</p><p><b>Branden Joseph</b> is Frank Gallipoli Professor of Modern and Contemporary Art in the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University.</p><p><b>Ed Kr?ma</b> is Lecturer in History of Art at the School of World Art and Museum Studies, University of East Anglia and co-editor of Enclave Review.</p><p><b>Michelle Kuo</b> is Professor in the History, Law, and Society program at the American University of Paris on issues related to race, punishment, immigration and the law.</p><p><b>Pamela Lee</b> is Carnegie Professor of Modern and Contemporary Art at Yale University.</p><p><b>Emily Liebert</b> is an American author.

All you really need is a passion for prose as good as it gets.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>In legend, cranes often figure as harbingers of heaven and omens of longevity and good fortune. And in nature, they are an &#x201c;umbrella species&#x201d; whose well-being assures that of the ecosystem at large. <i>The Birds of Heaven</i> chronicles Peter Matthiessen&#x2019;s many journeys on five continents in search of the fifteen species of cranes. His telling captures the dilemmas of a planet in ecological crisis, and the deep loss to humankind if these beautiful and imposing creatures are allowed to disappear.<br><br></p><p>Acclaimed writer Peter Matthiessen, a self-professed "craniac," has been observing and studying all kinds of birds most of his life, but his pursuit of cranes is closer to a spiritual quest than a naturalist's exercise. These majestic, mythic, and notoriously shy birds, capable of soaring at heights of 20,000 feet, are often fond of remote and rugged places, so just locating the birds can be difficult enough, determining an accurate number often impossible. Some locales, such as the breeding grounds on the Platte River in Nebraska, boast flocks half a million strong--"by far the greatest crane assemblies on earth"; other areas support only a precious few. Matthiessen's search for 15 different species of cranes has taken him to hidden corners of Siberia, China, Mongolia, Tibet, Sudan, and Australia (where Atherton cranes were not even discovered until 1961). Despite his many years of adventure and wide travels, each crane sighting is still a thrill for him, and his curiosity and contagious enthusiasm bring the book alive. But <i>The Birds of Heaven</i> also serves as an ecological warning: "Perhaps more than any other living creatures, they evoke the retreating wilderness, the vanishing horizons of clean water, earth, and air upon which their species--and ours, too, though we learn it very late--must ultimately depend for survival." <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i><br><b>Peter Matthiessen</b> is a writer, naturalist, environmental activist, and wilderness traveler whose many works of nonfiction include<i> The Snow Leopard</i>, and whose most recent novel is <i>Bone by Bone</i>, which concludes his powerful Watson trilogy.<br><br></p><h2>Daughter of the Forest (The Sevenwaters Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p><p><b><i>Daughter of the Forest</i>, the first book in Juliet Marillier's award-winning Sevenwaters Trilogy. </b></p><p>Lovely Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. Bereft of a mother, she is comforted by her six brothers who love and protect her. Sorcha is the light in their lives, they are determined that she know only contentment.</p><p>But Sorcha's joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can lift--by staying silent. If she speaks before she completes the quest set to her by the Fair Folk and their queen, the Lady of the Forest, she will lose her brothers forever. </p><p>When Sorcha is kidnapped by the enemies of Sevenwaters and taken to a foreign land, she is torn between the desire to save her beloved brothers, and a love that comes only once. Sorcha despairs at ever being able to complete her task, but the magic of the Fair Folk knows no boundaries, and love is the strongest magic of them all...</p></p><p>At the heart of this surprisingly accomplished first novel, first book of the Sevenwaters trilogy, is a retelling of an ancient Celtic legend. Marillier's story, however, is much more than a slightly disguised fairy tale. Young Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Irish Lord Colum of Sevenwaters, a domain well protected from invading Saxons and Britons by dense forest where, legend says, fey Deirdre, the Lady of the Forest, walks the woodland paths at night. Colum is first and foremost a warrior, bent on maintaining his lands against all outsiders. Not all of his sons are so bound to the old ways, and that family friction leads to outright disobedience when Sorcha and her brother Finbar help a Briton captive escape from Colum's dungeon. Soon after, Colum brings home a new wife who ensorcels everyone she can't otherwise manipulate. By her spell Sorcha's brothers are cursed to become swans. Only Sorcha, hiding deep in the forest, can break the spell by painfully weaving shirts of starwort nettle--but then Sorcha is captured by Britons and taken away across the sea. Determined to break the curse despite her captivity, Sorcha continues to work, little expecting that ultimately she will have to chose between saving her brothers and protecting the Briton lord who has defended her throughout her trials. Marillier's writing is deft and heartfelt, bypassing the usual bombast of fantasy fireworks for a rich, magical story of loyalty and love. <i>--Charlene Brusso</i><b>Juliet Marillier</b> achieved international recognition with the publication of the first two award-winning novels in the <i>Sevenwaters Trilogy</i>, a historical fantasy set in Ireland and Britain in the ninth century, and loosely based on the fairy tale &#x201c;The Six Swans&#x201d;.

Overbearing older brother Nicholas spends most of his time correcting silly Suzette. When she wishes she could pick all the flowers, for instance, he tells her, "Don't be so naughty and selfish. . . . The flowers are there for everybody to enjoy." Later he helps her climb the garden wall and shows her "the world," but "this is too much for Suzette to understand. She will think about the world another time." When we leave the children, Suzette is sleeping, but Nicholas is awake, staring at the moon. "Tomorrow he will tell Suzette all about the sky and the sun and the moon." Nicholas's patronizing attitude, cast here in a positive light, may annoy readers and parents.

A pioneer in the integration of health and medicine, he has served as contributing editor of <i>Women's Sports and Fitness</i> and <i>Allure</i> magazines and was the fitness expert for <i>Good Morning America</i>. He lives in New York City. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> This is not the first book ever written that concerns itself with the anatomical structures that are involved in exercise, nor is it intended to be the final word. It is not meant to be an exhaustive exploration of exercise vocabulary either. This book takes a unique and comprehensive stance on the anatomy of exercise, useful to laymen and professional alike. </p><p> Predominately, books that have included exercises with anatomical representations, whether or not they included instructions for performing the exercises, were targeted at two groups of readers: body builders and scientists. What I've tried to do with this book is to make this kind of information accessible and useful to anyone who exercises, including bodybuilders and scientists. To that end, this book includes exercise types typically overlooked in similar works, such as aerobic activities, stretches, and stability work. Moreover, this book takes into consideration the ways in which the body's systems depend on one another to generate movement. </p><p> In other texts of this nature, exercises have for the most part been depicted as using a specific muscle group because the book was intended to show how to develop size or strength in that particular muscle or group. Unfortunately, what often doesn't get mentioned is how the adjacent muscles and structures, as well as some that are not directly or obviously involved, contribute to the exercises and subsequent improvement. Hip and spine position, for instance, contribute to almost every major exercise and are integral not only to the proper biomechanics of a given movement, but the subsequent improvement of the targeted muscle. </p><p> For each exercise, the muscles indicated in the illustrations are identified as the ones that are primarily involved in the movement, whether they are active or stabilizing. Active or primary muscles are defined as those that contract to move a structure, while stabilizing muscles are defined as those that either co-contract, or, by their activation, stabilize either the primary or a secondary structure to allow movement. In a push-up, for instance, the primary active muscles act to extend the elbow and adduct the humerus (upper arm) at the shoulder joint. Primary stabilizers act to ensure that the elbow and shoulder joints remain steady and track properly; however, without the contraction of the deep spinal and pelvic musculature, as well as anterior leg musculature that contract to keep those joints stable and allow the ankle joint to act as a fulcrum, the movement is not possible. </p><p> The contribution of the secondary stabilizers varies in degree, depending on the movement. For example, in a barbell curl, since the weight is in front of the body and is translated in a curvilinear fashion that creates a greater forward lever and subsequent need for stabilization as it moves upward, the back and hip muscles become more relevant with regard to movement contribution. If the movement could simply not be performed without the contribution of these muscles, they were included. </p><p> The point here is to make the reader aware that during any given movement, some muscles that may not play a major role in the actual execution may still be necessary contributors for proper biomechanics and form while the exercise is being performed. The basic method I used to determine this was to ask whether or not the movement could be performed if the secondary stabilizers were injured, but readers should be aware that the specifics are open to some debate. </p><p> There is an enormous amount of variation that can be made to these exercises, since for any one single exercise there are perhaps four or five different ways to alter the stimulus (by changing the grip, foot position, altering the speed of the movement, and so forth). I have included some of these variations for many of the exercises. </p><p> This book contains the basic exercise vocabulary that any program can, and should, be built around, whether you are an elite athlete, a raw beginner, or are suffering from an injury. The specific exercises to use as well as intensity (the weight used, when relevant), volume (number of sets and repetitions), duration (time per session), and frequency (sessions per week) will all be determined by your own specific capacities and goals. The best and most effective way to determine these things is to consult a professional in the fitness/wellness/strength training profession for a program and prescription that suits your unique abilities and objectives. </p><p> The text is laid out in a structure that mimics the progression of a typical workout. While the text encompasses all of the elements pursuant to a comprehensive workout, it is not intended to be prescriptive in any way. The best use of this book is as a reference manual for understanding both positioning and muscular involvement for the included exercises, and should stimulate some thought, when performing a given exercise, about how the rest of your body plays a part in any particular movement. </p></p><h2>Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls</h2><p>This is the anarchic comedy of one man who realizes his secret ambition to get into the music industry&#x2014;managing a band called Gandhi's Hairdryer.

These ideas are summed up in his 'ten principles' of good design: good design is innovative, useful, and aesthetic. Good design should be make a product easily understood.

Originally from North Wales he is now based in Cheshire, UK.&#x201c;All...told in a competent and interesting way by author Charles Stephenson. I found it fascinating as the Channel Islands are not what one normally thinks of when thinking about WWII... The illustrations of Chris Taylor are absolutely superb and along with his maps, give one a real sense of how intensive the fortifications really were... A truly interesting book on a sidelight of the war.

Korten draws on evidence from evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, and religious teachings to show that a life-centered, egalitarian, sustainable, democratic "Earth Community" is possible.</p><p><p>The Great Turning<br> From Empire to Earth Community<br> By David C. Korten</p> <p>"We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when humanity must choose its future.... To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth Community with a common destiny."<br> --The Earth Charter (2000)</p> <p>David Korten's classic bestseller, <i>When Corporations Rule the World</i> was one of the first books to articulate the destructive and oppressive nature of the global corporate economy. Now, ten years later, Korten shows that the problem runs deeper than corporate domination, and with far greater consequences.</p> <p>In <i>The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community</i>, Korten argues that corporate consolidation of power is merely a contemporary manifestation of what he defines as "Empire"--the organization of society by hierarchies of domination grounded in violent chauvinisms of race, gender, religion, nationality, language, and class. The result has been the same for 5,000 years--fortune for the few and misery for the many. Now, thanks to modern technologies, the way of Empire is increasingly destructive to children, family, community, and nature itself, rapidly leading us all to the brink of worldwide environmental and social collapse.</p> <p>Korten makes the case that we are a species with the power of choice, and that at this defining moment in history, humanity faces both the opportunity and the imperative to choose our future in a conscious collective manner. A mounting perfect economic storm is fast approaching. A convergence of climate change, the fast approaching peak and decline in oil production, and the financial instability inherent in an unbalanced global trading system will bring an unraveling of the corporate-led global economy and a dramatic restructuring of every aspect of modern life--whether we like it or not.</p> <p>This unraveling cannot be avoided. We can, however, turn a potentially terminal crisis into an epic opportunity to bring forth a new era of Earth Community grounded in the life-affirming cultural values shared by most all the world's people and eloquently articulated in the Earth Charter.</p> <p><i>The Great Turning</i> is an essential resource for those who understand the need for fundamental change. It cuts through the complexity of our time to illuminate a simple, but elegant truth. We humans live by stories. We are held captive to the ways of Empire by a cultural trance of our own creation--indeed, one need look no further than our popular culture and the way it is magnified in TV, movies, and other mass media to see how this paradigm is reflected back upon us all everyday. Changing our future begins with changing our stories in a way that includes our capacities for compassion, cooperation, responsible self-direction, and self-organizing partnership. This is a work already underway, and to succeed, it ultimately will call for the participation of every person on the planet. In <i>The Great Turning</i>, David Korten points the way to the inspiring outcome within our reach.</p> <p>****</p> <p>"Here's the book we've been waiting for. We are not doomed to domination and suicidal competition. We can choose another story. This is the `Great Turning.'"<br> --Joanna Macy, author of <i>Coming Back to Life</i></p> <p>"An epic work. Exposes the myths that divide us and frames the stories that can bring us together."<br> --Danny Glover, activist and actor</p> <p>"<i>The Great Turning</i> is a work of amazing scope and depth. This is a wise and much needed book that shows we can create cultures where our enormous human capacities for joy, caring, and cooperation are realized."<br> --Riane Eisler, author of <i>The Chalice and the Blade</i></p> <p>"Employing history, psychology, economics, spirituality, and common sense, Korten not only critiques the dilemma we are in as a species, he also shows us doable and workable ways out of our morass. This book is a kind of Bible to the 21st century, a revelation of where we might travel if we have the moral imagination and the courage to choose and act wisely. Bravo!"<br> --Matthew Fox, educator and theologian, author of <i>Original Blessing</i> and <i>A New Reformation</i></p> <p>"David Korten has produced a masterpiece!

This is a must-read for activists, for lovers of contemporary American studies, and for Cultural Creatives."<br> --Paul H. Ray, co-author of <i>The Cultural Creatives</i></p> <p>"A must read for everyone who yearns to create a positive human future. <i>The Great Turning</i> is a wise, profound, and practical book filled with fresh insights and is destined to be even more influential than Korten's previous contributions"<br> -- Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop</p>"Korten cuts through the lies and hypocrisy to show that the rabid right, far from being conservative defenders of family values, is engaged in a war against children, families, communities, democracy, and life. Instead of the self-serving greedheads and boneheads now in charge, imagine a world guided by the deeply held values that most Americans share. The Great Turning has the power to turn our country, and the world, to this more positive course." - Jim Hightower, syndicated columnist and radio host, author of Let's Stop Beating Around the Bush <p>"David Korten never fails to shake me out of my complacency, and reveal complacencies I didn't even know I had. This work is a stunning and compassionate tour de force, calling on history, science, economics, and our human goodwill to illuminate the fact that we are at a fundamental choice point. I can't stop thinking about the issues he raises, nor what I'm going to do with my awakened consciousness. Thank you, David." - Margaret J. Wheatley, author of the bestsellers Leadership and the New Science and Finding Our Way: Leadership for an Uncertain Time </p><p>"The Great Turning is a profound and inspiring masterpiece that illuminates the cultural, social, and political significance of the contrasting worldviews of the classic materialistic-mechanistic Newtonian physics and modern holistic-quantum physics. Korten eloquently points to the necessity of abandoning the dominating power-oriented plutocracy of Empire in favor of a life-enhancing, continuously diversifying, cooperatively integrated Earth." - Prof. Dr.h.c.Hans-Peter Duerr PhD, former Director, Max-Planck-Institute for Physics, Munich; Winner, Alternative Nobel Prize 1987 </p><p>"With the majesty of a George Lucas movie, Korten's epic tale, which pits Earth Community against Empire, weaves together the great social movements of our time. It inspires us at this crucial point in history to fulfill our destiny as thinking, acting and loving human beings." - Judy Wicks, Proprietress, White Dog Cafe and co-chair Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE) </p><p>"The Great Turning is a work of amazing scope and depth. David Korten powerfully addresses the great challenge for humanity at this critical juncture in history: shifting from domination to partnership as the guiding principle for personal, economic, and political relations. Passionately, and with his customary attention to solid evidence, he traces the tension between these two underlying human possibilities. This is a wise and much needed book that shows we can create cultures where our enormous human capacities for joy, caring, and cooperation are realized." -Riane Eisler, author of The Chalice and the Blade </p><p>"This is a hugely important book, and hugely impressive! I imagine it reaching far beyond Korten's existing readership." -Raffi Cavoukian, singer, author, ecology advocate, founder of Child Honoring </p><p>"In this major work, inspired by a compelling spiritual and ethical vision, The Great Turning argues persuasively that the 21st century presents humanity with a unique opportunity to break with its violent past and to create a just, participatory, sustainable, and peaceful future. David Korten skillfully combines ecological, economic, social, psychological, and cultural analysis in order to issue a powerful summons to local communities and the emerging global civil society to lead the way.

Exposes the myths that divide us and frames the stories that can bring us together." -Danny Glover, Activist and Actor </p><p>"David Korten has presented a clear blueprint for a powerful emerging majority. This book will help to change America for the better." -Dennis J. Kucinich, US House of Representatives (D-Ohio) </p><p>"David Korten's ideas are tools, like picks and shovels, that help us dig under the surface of our pessimism and fear of change. What we find is a deep core of hope for the Earth as Beloved Community and the ability to embrace the individual and collective kuleana (Hawaiian for responsibility) for our choices and their consequences." - Puanani Burgess, Hawaiian storyteller and poet </p><p>"The Great Turning is smooth, brilliantly researched, and gripping. David Korten has constructed a story of hope and insight. Alert the Democrats! Here is a blueprint for a vision they are born to promote to the world. Look for the section on Empire's War on the Family. The ending inspires poetically. Things aren't hopeless, the world is truly turning and all we need do is push ourselves along together." - Dal LaMagna, Founder and former CEO, Tweezerman </p><p>"David Korten is a militant for Life, Earth, and Community. This ground-breaking book provides the holistic overview of a 21st Century revolution and evolution that can inspire the ordinary citizen to act and transform the activist into a long-distance runner." - Grace Lee Boggs, Detroit activist, co-author of Revolution and Evolution in the 20th Century </p><p>"Throw away the technological fixes of Thomas Friedman and Jeffrey Sachs and enter Korten's world where communities organize to secure their rights and build a better world. I know of no writer who better embraces the wisdom of such a broad spectrum of thinkers to create new understanding, new possibilities, new inspiration, new hope." - John Cavanagh, director, Institute for Policy Studies, board chair, International Forum on Globalization, and co-author of 12 books on the global economy </p><p>"This is indeed a spectacular book. The Great Turning supports our most open-hearted evolutionary process. I will buy several cases." - Bill Kauth, co-founder of the ManKind Project and author of A Circle of Men </p><p>"Brilliant. Challenging. Inspiring. Practical. Spiritual. Intelligent. Once again David Korten challenges us with his keen analysis, and elegant wisdom-a clear call for sustainable social transformation and a timely invitation to live a different story. Korten gives us exactly what we need to address our paralysis and fear. Read this book and be inspired to make a difference. I look forward to using The Great Turning in my education and public witness work. Korten's voice deserves to be heard far and wide." - The Very Reverend Bill Phipps, moderator United Church of Canada (1997 to 2000) </p><p>"Not only are we the ones we have been waiting for, THIS is the book we have been waiting for! It provides the context and stories that have been missing, leaving us with piecemeal analyses and solutions. The framework of the 5,000 year history of the Empire is a powerful eye-opener about the deliberateness of enslavement and oppression. Off and on, I heard in my head the words, the emperor has no clothes..." - Jan Roberts, Director, Earth Charter USA Communities Initiatives </p><p>Once you dive into this book, you'll want everyone you know to read it. It is a powerful source of inspiration and guidance for those already turning to Earth Community and it can help those embedded in Empire's institutions see more clearly the choices before them. - Alisa Gravitz, Executive Director, Co-op America</p></p><h2>The Death of Sweet Mister</h2><p>The final chapter in Daniel Woolrell&#39;s Ozark trilogy peels the lid back on a dysfunctional Missouri family as infidelity threatens to consume their world in violence and terror. By the author of Give Us a Kiss and Tomato Red. Reprint.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, June 2001:</b> This is Daniel Woodrell's third book set in the Ozarks and, like the other two, <i>Give Us a Kiss</i> and <i>Tomato Red</i>, it peels back the layers from lives already made bare by poverty and petty crime, exposing the reader to the raw everyday hopes and fears of the poor and the helpless.<p> Told through the voice of an overweight 13-year-old boy named Shuggy Atkins, this is the story of Shug; the one person who loves him, his mother Glenda; and her boyfriend Red, a brutal and ignorant man. Red hates Shug but uses him to break into houses to steal drugs and anything else that can be sold. Glenda makes a meager living looking after the local cemetery and spends her time trying to keep Red amused and away from Shug, whom he loves to humiliate but whom she adores. Glenda is Shug's only champion. She calls him Sweet Mister as she continually boosts his confidence and promises a better life for him, if not for herself.</p><p> But when Glenda sees a beautiful, green Thunderbird with leather seats and its driver, Jimmy Vin Pearce, a chain of events is set into motion that will end in violence and bloodshed. Glenda must keep hidden from Red her infatuation with Jimmy Vin's money and fine clothes while she and Shug dream separate dreams of making a new life away from the violence.</p><p> Woodrell writes books that are small in volume but large in scope. It is impossible to put down this story of less than 200 pages until the final tragedy unfolds. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Daniel Woodrell is the author of six widely acclaimed novels, including <b>Tomato Red</b>, for which he received a PEN West fiction award in 1998.</p><h2>Dark Horse Six: A Memoir of the Korean War, 1950-1951</h2><p>&#34;For two miserable weeks, with temperatures hovering between 20 and 40 degrees below zero, the outnumbered allied ground troops held off a Chinese army that had been ordered to annihilate them. When the running fight ended on Dec. 11 (1950) nearly 7,000 allied troops had been killed or wounded, and many of the casualties were victims of frostbite. The Chinese suffered an estimated 30,000 casualties. Historically, only the battle of the Alamo and Custer&#39;s Last Stand matched such seemingly hopeless odds. Like the Alamo, Chosin produced its own famous battle cry. According to a Time magazine account From Dec. 18, 1950, Major Gen. Oliver P. Smith, Commander of the First Marine Division, (the very same Marine Division fighting in Iraq today), set the tone for the battle by snapping, &#34;Retreat, hell! We&#39;re not retreating, were just advancing in a different direction!&#34; Dark Horse Six, is the combat memoir of Colonel Robert D. Taplett. He was the commander of one of the USMC&#39;s most famed battalions, the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment, during the first year of fighting in Korea. His battalion&#39;s radio call sign during the bitter fighting against the Chinese was Dark Horse. After 50 years he has decided to tell his story. He wants the deeds of his Marines put into the record. The mistakes of combat, planning and egos are here as well. His experience was on the front lines, not theorizing behind some desk. THIS IS A WARRIOR&#39;S STORY!</p><p></p><h2>Conan the Conqueror</h2><p>The long tapers flickered, sending the black shadows wavering along the walls, and the velvet tapestries rippled. Yet there was no wind in the chamber. Four men stood about the ebony table on which lay the green sarcophagus that gleamed like carven jade. In the upraised right hand of each man a curious black candle burned with a weird greenish light. Outside was night and a lost wind moaning among the black trees. Inside the chamber was tense silence, and the wavering of the shadows, while four pairs of eyes, burning with intensity, were fixed on the long green case across which cryptic hieroglyphics writhed, as if lent life and movement by the unsteady light. The man at the foot of the sarcophagus leaned over it and moved his candle as if he were writing with a pen, inscribing a mystic symbol in the air. Then he set down the candle in its black gold stick at the foot of the case, and, mumbling some formula unintelligible to his companions, he thrust a broad white hand into his fur&#x2013;trimmed robe. When he brought it forth again it was as if he cupped in his palm a ball of living fire.</p><p></p><h2>Myths of Origin: Four Short Novels</h2><p><ul> <li>Live the Myth! <i>New York Times</i> best-seller Catherynne M.

Warren&#x2019;s latest poems tend to veil their complexity in understatement.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Harvard Review</em></strong></p> In her fifth collection, Rosanna Warren draws inspiration not only from her own life but also from the works of other artists, both classical and contemporary, real and imagined. Warren explores the political and the personal through myth, history, elegy, and erotic lyric. She eulogizes her mother in poems such as &#x201c;Mediterranean,&#x201d; where she writes, &#x201c;the mystery was / not that she walked there, ten years after her death, / / but that she vanished, and let twilight take her place&#x2015;.&#x201d; In other poems, Warren contemplates wreckage and sorrow in family life, in Hurricane Katrina, and in the Trojan War, but also moments of eerie blessing. In her most forceful collection to date, she obsessively traces themes, both ancient and modern, in a voice compelling and deeply persuasive.<br><br> from "Mediterranean"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>There was something I wanted to say, at the age of twelve,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some question she hadn't answered,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yesterday, so clearly seeing her pace before me<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it rose again to the tip of my tongue, and the mystery was<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not that she walked there, ten years after her death,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that she vanished, and let twilight take her place&#x2015;</em></p><p>Rosanna Warren, the author of four collections of poetry, has received awards from the Academy of Arts and Letters and has won the Lamont Poetry Prize. She teaches at the University of Chicago and lives in Chicago.Warren's fifth book of poetry spans a wide range of topics, from classical mythology to personal traumas to both real and imagined histories. Warren approaches each subject with great directness. "I am willing to be rewritten," she says, and, "as long as the danger lived outside/ me I couldn't write it." These poems struggle to take others' pain in and then articulate it. One group of poems remembers her friend the poet and editor Deborah Tall: "We touched hands, touched cheeks, as much/ to ascertain we still had bodies as to show/ the courtesies of separation." Warren revives Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who famously designed Central Park, with the same intimacy she uses to recall memories of her loved ones in the extended meditation "Earthworks," which intertwines Olmsted's biography with quotes from Emerson's essays.

Elly&#39;s early pregnancy was to be made bearable only by the willingness of her unmarried sister, Betty, to come and see her through her confinement - but would Betty&#39;s presence only widen the rift between husband and wife, or would she help to bring about reconciliation?</p><p>Elly and Joe Remington marry and settle in Joe&#39;s rural hometown, but Elly can&#39;t forget her aristocratic background and tries to put everyone in their place, much to the chagrin of her husband. She rapidly becomes disliked by the town and her husband&#39;s friends. Can she fix the mess she&#39;s made? Elizabeth Henry reads this tale in a slow, terse voice and creates the characters with shrill intonation and a panoply of accents. Henry&#39;s characterization of Elly fits her perfectly, making the listener dislike her as much as the townspeople in the story. M.B.K. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThis will be a popular item for light summer listening. Cookson's (The Year of the Virgins, Audio Reviews, LJ 7/94) story, set in the English countryside, follows the disastrous marriage of a young Englishman from its beginnings in the 1920s to a happy, if not traditional, conclusion in the 1940s. The young man, Joe Remington, and his new bride Elaine return to his family home near Felburn. Elly cannot understand why Joe treats the servants as if they are, well, human. When Elly becomes pregnant, much against her wishes, she insists that her sister Betty come to care for her and the household. Betty is as plain as Elly is pretty and as kind as Elly is cruel. Will the good woman, Betty, end up with the good man, Joe, when his wife, who we are none too sorry to see go, is conveniently removed from the picture? Elizabeth Henry gives a fine reading, providing each character with a distinct voice and personality. This isn't profound literature; the plot is somewhat contrived, and the characters don't have much depth, even if the story moves along quite well. Still, Cookson's fans will check this out, and others seeking a light listen will enjoy it, too.

It goes back to when the Algonquin and Mohawk Indians roamed the endless forests of northeast New York, soon to be adjoined by the first European settlers, whose daily provisions consisted of game, fish, fruits, maple syrup, wild mushrooms, nuts, and wild berries. Throughout the following centuries, as mankind developed his agricultural skills and people from all over the world brought their culinary knowledge, the combination of natural resources, farming techniques, and cooking skills/equipment evolved the inception of Adirondack Cooking. These recipes are from the Bed &amp; Breakfast Inns in the area including The Bent Finial Manor, the Goose Pond Inn, and the Moose River House.

Hoppin' John Taylor has&nbsp;&nbsp;traveled from Hilton Head to Memphis, from&nbsp;&nbsp;Louisville to Birmingham, from Bethesda to Miami to find&nbsp;&nbsp;out. He's collected more than 200 authentic southern dishes from the finest private homes in Charleston, the best Creole restaraunt in New Orleans, and&nbsp;&nbsp;the recipe files of great chefs and cooks in kitchens from Dallas to Richmond. You're in for some wonderful surprises as you encounter the varied, energetic cuisine of today's South--and discover the kind of food that nourishes not only the body but the soul.</p><p>John Martin Taylor is one of the cooks and writers devoted to preserving traditional Southern American cooking and to reviving interest in it. He is also creatively talented in the kitchen. Taylor, known as "Hoppin' John," focused on the traditions of the South in an earlier book, <i>Hoppin' John's Lowcountry Cooking</i>. In <i>The New Southern Cook,</i> he offers regional dishes gathered from local chefs and cooks from Texas to Appalachia, in addition to his own great cookin'. With the background Taylor provides, you'll appreciate dishes from Virginia's Peanut Soup to Peanut Hummus, and Deep-Fried Turkey Breast to Banana-Fried Sea Bass. Noting that cooking evolves as a living thing, he considers Green Tomato Soup and Tequila-Glazed Pork Roast as legitimate and Southern as Carrots in Ginger Ale and Crab Cakes. A wine aficionado, he provides recommendations with many dishes, but suggests beer or lemonade with barbecue!"Reading this book for me is like taking a trip to my home in the Carolina Lowcountry--a treasure to delight all cooks, especially those of the southern school."-- Pat Conroy, author of <i>The Prince of Tides.</i> <p>"Few regional cookbooks aim quite as high as this one, but the unorthodox scope of Taylor's survey is no surprise to those who marveled at his fanatical devotion...Taylor's done exactly what regional cookbooks should do and usually don't." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p></p><h2>In the Women&#39;s Clubhouse: The Greatest Women Golfers in Their Own Words</h2><p>Offers reminiscences and views by women golfers offering more than a century of experiences, and detailing the obstacles they had to face, the pleasures and difficulties of the game, and their role in the development of the sport.</p><p>Terri Leonard is an amateur golfer who has competed in the Executive Women&#39;s Golf League national championship and is active in local golf clinics for young women.

Wyeth returned to windows during the course of the next 60 years, producing more than 300 remarkable works that explore both the formal and conceptual richness of the subject. Absent from these spare, elegant, almost abstract paintings is the narrative element inevitably associated with Wyeth's better-known figural compositions. In 2014 the National Gallery of Art, Washington, presents an exhibition of a select group of these deceptively realistic works, window paintings that are in truth skillfully manipulated compositions centering on the visual complexities posed by the transparency, beauty and formal structure of windows. In its exclusive focus on paintings without human subjects, this catalogue offers a new approach to Wyeth's work and represents the first time that his non-figural works have been published as a group since the 1990s.</p><p>The authors explore Wyeth's fascination with windows--their formal structure and metaphorical complexity. In essays that address links with the poetry of Robert Frost and the paintings of Edward Hopper, Charles Sheeler and other artistic peers, the authors consider Wyeth's statement that he was, in fact, an abstract painter.</p><p>American painter <b>Andrew Wyeth</b> (1917-2009) lived his entire life in his birthplace of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and his summer home in mid-coast Maine. His seven-decade career was spent painting the land and people that he knew and cared about. Renowned for his tempera "Christina's World" (1948), Wyeth navigated between artistic representation and abstraction in a highly personal way.</p></p><p>This catalogue for a National Gallery of Art exhibition uses Wind from the Sea (l947, tempera on hardboard), showing a window with a blowing curtain, as exemplifying a major theme of Wyeth's. The window depicted is in the second story of the house where Wyeth had a studio (the house depicted in his famous Christina's World ). This reassessment of Wyeth's achievement features an introduction by curators Anderson and Brock (both, National Gallery) on windows as subject matter in Wyeth's paintings. They found some 300 window images in Wyeth's oeuvre. In the first essay "Wind from the Sea: Painting Truth beneath the Facts," Anderson looks at the creation and provenance of the painting from Wyeth's easel to the National Gallery in 2009, and its relationships to poetry of Robert Frost. Brock's essay, "Through a Glass: The Window in the Art of Andrew Wyeth, Charles Sheeler, and Edward Hopper," compares Wyeth with these other leaders of American realism, using windows as a theme. Also discussed is the role of women in their work. This intriguing catalogue is significant for the seriousness and depth of its insights (often lacking in Wyeth commentary). It includes beautiful color plates and a 60-item exhibition checklist. Summing Up: Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates and above; general readers. (W.L. K Whitwell <i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>ANDREW WYETH: LOOKING OUT, LOOKING IN by Nancy Anderson and Charles Brock, assembles sixty splendidly reproduced Wyeth paintings and watercolors that employ windows as motifs. Favoring stripped-down winter landscapes and nearly empty interiors, Wyeth savored windows' ability to isolate nearly abstract forms outdoors or to transform an interior with a play of shadow-in fact, he declared himself an 'abstract painter.' But he employs light like a poet, particularly in the book's opening series of spreads, an overture of full-bleed details with metaphoric resonance, which announce Wyeth's visual themes: reflection, illumination, luminosity, shadows and patterns. (Christopher Lyon <i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>The works share a theme that has interested artists for centuries: windows. Wyeth's approach to that subject is as distinctive as it is haunting. (Tim Smith <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>)<br><br>The absorbing new Wyeth exhibition, &#x201c;Andrew Wyeth: Looking Out, Looking In,&#x201d; is in certain respects the opposite of the Helga show, even something of an exorcism of it. Where the Helga show was dominated by a single human figure, the current exhibition is entirely without people, except for a couple of preparatory sketches... Instead of such cacophonous material, the current show is built around a single, quiet motif in many variations: the window. <p></p> The result of the carefully concieved installation, in which preparatory studies are grounded around more finished and often drastically simplified paintings, is an increasingly immersive experience, an aesthetic revelation rather than prurient one. The catalog essays, by National Gallery curators Nancy Anderson (on Wyeth's working process) and Charles Brock (comparing Wyeth's windows to two influences, Edward Hopper and the Pennsylvania precisionist Charles Sheeler), are understanded, inquisitive, and well written... (Christopher Benfey <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Andrew Wyeth: Looking Out, Looking In" comprises 60 beautifully displayed works featuring windows. All were painted during four decades (1947-88) around Wyeth's home in Chadds Ford, Pa., and Cushing, Maine, where the artist summered. In both places he befriended neighbors and painted portraits of them and their dwellings.

She was out here in the woods to find pinecones for a Sunday school project, not accessories. She set down the last of the lemon bar and coffee she'd brought for breakfast&#x2014;Amelia didn't believe in sensible breakfasts, ever&#x2014;and picked up the glove from its place among the scattered pinecones. Large, well made, worn to a comfortable softness, it was definitely a man's glove&#x2014;one that would be missed, so she should try to find its owner. She chuckled as her mind made the connection; a woman whose life's work was a charity called Here to Help ought to be able to help one glove find the man who owned it.<br><br>Not that Amelia was looking to find a man&#x2014;gloved or otherwise&#x2014;these days. Just over a year out from a publicly broken engagement, Amelia was barely starting to feel as if talk had died down and she could be seen as Little Horn's best helping hand, not its saddest broken heart.<br><br>She was tucking the glove in her pocket when she spotted its mate ten feet away. Then a boot...and a leg...until there, lying under the largest of the pine trees, Amelia spied the owner of those gloves.<br><br>She blinked a few times, startled to see a large, ruggedly dressed man sprawled in the wet needles under the boughs. "Sir?" The angle of his arms and legs wasn't that of sleep, and last night's storm certainly wasn't conducive to camping out under the stars. Amelia dropped the gloves and her pack on the ground and walked over to shake the man's shoulder. "Hey, sir, are you all right?"<br><br>He didn't respond. <em>Lord, help me, what do I do?</em> she prayed as she looked around for any sign of companions or transportation. Short of Louie, her own horse, who stood inspecting a clump of grass behind her, Amelia was alone. She didn't recognize the rather handsome man; he was clean-cut, well if casually dressed, but mud-smeared as if he'd been out here all night. As if he'd come to some kind of mishap. "Are you hurt? Sick? You don't look like you should..."<br><br>Amelia swallowed her words as the man groaned and turned his head to reveal a grisly wound across his forehead. "Oh, mercy!" Amelia gasped, fumbling back to her backpack for her cell phone. She had to call 911. This man needed an ambulance.<br><br>The phone was no help&#x2014;she should have known she'd get no cell service way out here. How was she going to get this poor soul to help? Amelia twisted a blond curl around her fingers in panicked consideration of her options. Sometimes text got through on almost no service and she was good friends with Lucy Benson, the sheriff. Would Lucy be nearby on a Saturday morning? She pulled up Lucy's cell number and typed Emergency!<br><br>She shook the man gently, pulling the scarf from her neck to wipe the worst of the drying blood from his face.<br><br>Someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014;had taken a good whack at his forehead. Accident? Fight? Bandit? Little Horn had been experiencing its own odd crime spree in recent weeks, so there was no telling if the attractive man on the ground before her was a good guy or a bad one. If the past year had taught her anything, it was that bad guys could come in good-looking packages.<br><br>Hero or villain, this was a hurt man in need of help, and right now she was the only help to be had. Carefully, she rolled him fully onto his back, which made him wince. "Sorry about this," she offered as she rummaged through his pockets for a phone, wallet or, hopefully, car keys to a truck just out of sight.<br><br>The search came up empty. No keys, no wallet, no phone. "Looks like someone had it in for you, mister." Given all the robberies taking place in Little Horn of late, it wasn't hard to think the criminals had expanded their cattle and equipment theft to face-to-face holdups. It took a special brand of mean to not only take a man's valuables, but to dump him unconscious in the middle of nowhere. "Come on there, cowboy, wake up. This'd be a whole lot easier with you conscious."<br><br>Her phone dinged an incoming text from Lucy. Hurt? Gramps?<br><br>It would be natural for Lucy to think any emergency of Amelia's involved the elderly grandfather who lived with her, but not this time. Found injured man in woods just over ridge behind Palmer's Creek. Call 9-1-1 for me?<br><br>I'm not too far from there. On my way.<br><br>Some days it paid well to be best friends with the local sheriff. "Help is on the way," she told the unconscious man. Wasn't it important to keep concussion victims awake? Why hadn't she paid more attention when watching medical dramas? <em>Try talking to him.</em> She grasped one of his broad, solid shoulders and shook him a little harder. "Do you hurt anywhere? What's your name?"<br><br>No response other than a groan, but he had moved his hand and Amelia spied a watch. "Why'd they leave your watch when they took everything else?" She began unbuckling the old, worn timepiece&#x2014;it was a long shot, but maybe the watch could at least give her a name or initials if it was engraved.<br><br>It was. <em>Finn: all my love, B.</em> Mystery man had a name&#x2014;and someone who missed him. "You're no slouch to look at, Finn, B's a lucky lady. And worried, I expect." She'd spent enough time praying for her now-ex-fiance, Rafe, to come off duty from the Texas Rangers safe and sound that her heart twisted in sympathy for the likely frantic B. It looked as if Finn had been out here all night, if not longer. "Wake up, Finn." She leaned in closer to his fine features. "Finn! Finn, can you hear me?"<br><br>A hint of awareness washed over the man's features. He dwarfed her&#x2014;she guessed him to be over six feet tall and very fit. "Can you sit up?" She tried to pull his chest vertical, but he winced and his eyes shot wide open. They locked on to her for a second, a startling sky blue contrast to his glossy dark brown hair, before losing focus again as he fell back to the ground and murmured, "Ouch."<br><br>"I guess you're more hurt than you look." Amelia pushed up the fleece he wore to see blood staining the shirt underneath. "Mercy, Finn, I don't think you should move at all. Help is on the way, so you just sit still."<br><br>His hand moved to his chest. "Ribs." He said, the word slurring a bit.<br><br>"You might have cracked a few of those, and you're definitely bleeding." She took her scarf from behind his head and bunched it up against the red spot on his shirt. "Stay with me, Finn. Keep those eyes open." She grabbed Finn's hand, finding it alarmingly cold, and guided it to press against the scarf on his wound. His eyes found her again, the fear and confusion in his gaze going straight to the pit of her stomach.<br><br>"My name's Amelia, and I'm getting you help." She bit her lip. "You just stick with me, okay?"<br><br>Finn nodded his head. When he coughed, she could see the pain shoot through him even as he grabbed her hand. "Where am...?" Finn's words fell off into a sharp hiss as he tried to rise again.<br><br>Amelia put a hand gently to his shoulder. "Oh, no, you don't. You'd better stay still."<br><br>Finn's eyes wandered again, then returned to her as he let his head fall back against the ground. He looked at her as if she was the only person in his world&#x2014;and right now, wasn't she? "Where am I?" he asked in halting words.<br><br>"You're in...well, the middle of nowhere, really." She grabbed his free hand&#x2014;the one where the watch had been&#x2014;and held it, stroking his forearm in an effort to keep him calm. <em>Keep him talking to you.</em> "What on earth made you come up into the forest in last night's storm? Or did someone just dump you here?"<br><br>"I..." Finn's eyes rolled back and his lids fell shut. The hand Amelia was touching lost its tension and dropped to his chest.<br><br>He'd lost consciousness again&#x2014;that couldn't be good news. "Lord," Amelia prayed aloud, helplessness pushing her pulse higher, "I need to know what to do here.<br><br>Don't You let Finn die before help comes. Don't You do that to him or to me." She laid her hand against Finn's chest, grateful to feel breath and a heartbeat.<br><br>Amelia checked her phone again, then used the edge of her jacket to blot the sheen of sweat now beading Finn's forehead. "Finn? Finn, wake up. Show me those nice blue eyes." She grabbed his hand again, shaking it a bit to rouse him. "I found your gloves." That struck her as a ridiculous thing to say, but she didn't have a lot of experience making conversation with men out cold. Gramps fell asleep nightly&#x2014;okay, hourly&#x2014;in his re-cliner, but that was different. "Come on, Finn, give a gal a break. Open your eyes. Groan a little. Let me know you're still in there."<br><br>Finn seemed to grow more still, even the tension in his rugged features going soft as if falling sleep. Was he dying? He was such a nice-looking guy&#x2014;if she discounted the mud, leaves and blood. Far too dashing to meet his end out here in a pile of pine needles.<br><br>Her phone beeped again. Shout out the text from Lucy said. Amelia dropped Finn's hand and stood to yell "Lucy!" at the top of her lungs. She heard the distant rumble of an engine and dashed over to the side of the ridge to see a little all-terrain vehicle scrambling up the hillside with Lucy's white police SUV not far behind. Some distance back, Amelia could see the flashing lights of what had to be an ambulance.<br><br>"Here!" Amelia yelled again, jumping up and down and waving her arms as relief filled her chest. "Over here!"<br><br>When the ATV veered in her direction, Amelia dashed back to Finn, still motionless on the ground.<br><br>"It's okay, Finn," she said, mopping his face again.<br><br>"We're gonna get you out of here." She grabbed his hand, breathless and surprisingly near tears. "Help is here. You're safe."<br><br>"Hello there. Welcome back. I'm Dr. Searle." A man in tortoiseshell glasses was peering at him as if he was a science experiment. The doctor's warm tone felt suspiciously rehearsed. "Can you tell me your name?"<br><br>His name? His name seemed just out of reach. The combination of pain and confusion left him feeling weightless and heavy at the same time&#x2014;as if he couldn't tell up from down or left from right. He couldn't answer.<br><br>The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Amelia found a watch on your wrist inscribed to Finn. Is that your name?"<br><br>"Sounds...right," he said, mostly because he didn't know what else to say. Amelia? Did he know that name?<br><br>"Well, let's go with Finn for now. Tell me, can you see my face clearly?" Dr. Searle asked.<br><br>"Uh...I guess so." Glory, even his teeth hurt. His tongue felt dry and sluggish. Where did this awful headache come from? Why did everything feel so out of place?<br><br>Dr. Searle switched on a small light and waved it back and forth. "Do you know where you are?"<br><br>"No." Admitting that made the pounding in his head go double-time, a steady rhythm of <em>not-good, not-good, not-good.</em><br><br>"You're in the Little Horn Regional Medical Center. Amelia Klondike found you unconscious in the woods early this morning. Can you tell me how you got there?"<br><br>The pounding turned into a slam, with a sucker punch of fear to his gut. "No." Hospital? In the woods? Out cold? Come to think of it, he couldn't remember anything about <em>anything</em> except that this Amelia person sounded a bit familiar. The air turned thin and his head began to spin. "My head hurts. And my ribs."<br><br>"I expect so. You've had a concussion, along with a few broken ribs and several nasty lacerations. Whatever hit you was big and mean. Took your wallet and your phone and left you out in the storm from the looks of it. Amelia said you had nothing on you but the watch."<br><br>Amelia. He focused on the half-familiar name and remembered a vague impression of some very pretty blue eyes and a soft, soothing voice. Everything else was a blank.<br><br>"Well, Finn, it seems the knock on your head has rattled things around a bit. I'd try not to worry about it. It's not that unusual for head-trauma patients to lose the hours around their injury at first."<br><br>Finn didn't like that he'd said "that unusual." And he hadn't just lost a few hours&#x2014;right now it felt as if he'd lost everything. The spinning started again and he closed his eyes.<br><br>"I'm going to run some tests and give your description to the police. We might not be able to learn much over the weekend, but it's worth a shot. Can you tell me if Finn is your first name, a last name or a nickname?"<br><br>Finn licked his dry, cracked lips. It hurt to think. For that matter, it hurt to breathe. "I don't know." He put his hand to his forehead, immediately regretting the sparks of pain it sent through the back of his eyes.<br><br>The doctor put a hand on Finn's arm. "Try not to get all worked up. You must have friends or family looking for you. It won't take long to sort things out."<br><br>If Dr. Searle could have picked the one idea to make Finn feel worse... The haunting sense that no one was missing him or searching for him, that he was alone, was as deep as it was inexplicable. "I don't remember anything, Doc." It felt as if the admission swallowed him whole.<br><br>"It'll likely come back to you in the next few hours. Are you up for a visitor? Amelia's been out in the lobby waiting for you to wake up, and if you ask me, you could do with a distraction right about now."<br><br>"Sure." After all, this Amelia was the only thing he thought he remembered right now.<br><br>Dr. Searle gave him a half casual, half concerned smile as he moved to the door and opened it.<br><br>"Well, look at you, awake and everything."<br><br>"Amelia" swept into the room with a bouquet of flowers and a bundle of plaid fabric. The particular turquoise of her eyes did feel vaguely familiar, as did her voice. In fact, her voice and eyes were the only memory he could pull up at all.<br><br>She deposited the flowers on his bedside table with a hopeful smile. As rescue squads went, she was pretty easy on the eyes with a tumble of blond hair and a petite, curvy figure. "Do you remember me? I found you early this morning."<br><br>"A bit." He had no idea what to say.<br><br>"Dr. Searle says you'll recover just fine despite being pretty banged up. Gramps broke a rib once&#x2014;I know it isn't much fun."<br><br>Should he know who Gramps was? "It's not." Finn stared at her, feeling as if he ought to know more about her but coming up short. All he remembered was the sound of her voice saying <em>You 're safe</em> and the blue of her eyes. And her hand. He remembered her holding his hand. He started to say <em>You're the only thing I remember,</em> but changed his mind.<br><br></p><h2>A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax</h2><p>A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax [mass_market] Gilman, Dorothy [Dec 12, 1980] ...</p><p>My grandmother is a big fan of the MRS. POLLIFAX mysteries by Dorothy Gilman. I was at first hesitant<br>to try the books, because I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to mysteries featuring a suburban grandmother<br>working for the CIA. But because my grandmother's taste in literature has always been impeccable,<br>I decided to delve into Mrs. Pollifax's adventures. I began with THE UNEXPECTED MRS. POLLIFAX, the first<br>in the series, and immediately found them delightful. Mrs. Pollifax is just the kind of grandmother I'd<br>love to have: resourceful, intelligent, somewhat sly, and, of course, a secret CIA operative. Her<br>adventures take her to all corners of the globe: from an authentically described communist China <br>(MRS. POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION) to an exhilarating safari across Africa (MRS. POLLIFAX ON <br>SAFARI). I've thoroughly enjoyed joining her on her adventures, and intend to read them all. I recommend them<br>to everyone who's interested in learning about different countries and cultures--and, obviously, espionage!<br><br>--Malinda Lo, Editorial Assistant"Mrs. Pollifax gives Agatha Christie's Miss Marple a rival to reckon with."<br>TORONTO STAR<br>A secret agent like no other, Mrs. Pollifax was leading a very full life: Garden Club, karate, yoga--and a little spying now and then. This time the mysterious Mr. Carstairs sent her to Switzerland--to a famous health resort where the world's intelligence agents had gathered. Her mission: to track down a missing package of plutonium--just enough to make a small atomic bomb. It was a job that suited Mrs. Pollifax's talents. She's good with people and even better at sniffing out their secrets. But it was not until she became enchanted with Robin, the young jewel thief, that her new adventure really began....</p><h2>Disfarmer: The Heber Springs portraits, 1939-1946</h2><p>A fascinating collection of portraits of the townspeople of Heber Springs, Arkansas. Disfarmer was not well liked by the townfolk but they came to him to get their photos taken. He made no attempt to elicit a smile or adhere to any other other convention of commercial portraiture poses. So the photos tend to be of people as they were; not as they might have been "photographed." 135 pages; illustrated through out with b&amp;w photographic plates; 10.25 x 11 inches.</p><p></p><h2>The Autobiography Box</h2><p>The memoir is fast gaining on the novel as the most popular literary form for readers and writers today. Gone are the days when people used to talk over the back fence, swapping stories and the day's gossip. Enter the next best thing: the autobiography, back porch conversation in book form. Contemporary and fresh, <i>The Autobiography Box</i> presents innovative writing suggestions in a visually dynamic, totally inviting, hands-on portable kit. Sixty appealing cards filled with quotes, questions, directions, and exercises provide the practice, while an engaging book with journal spaces for fill-in and excerpts from such literary greats as Vladimir Nabokov, Marcel Proust, Muriel Spark, and Tobias Wolff offer the inspiration. Perfect for both beginning and seasoned writers, <i>The Autobiography Box</i> is all any memoirist needs to get started-that and maybe a comfy porch swing and a tall glass of lemonade.</p><p>Inside a pretty little box with a sepia-tone photograph of a manual typewriter on the cover is a compact journal with a sepia-tone photograph of crumpled paper on its cover and 60 smooth, oversize cards (yes, more sepia). The cards--labeled "remember," "discover," "dramatize," and "structure"--are meant to assist in your memoir writing. OK, so it's a gimmick. But it surely beats the many hokey, answer-the-questions amateur memoir guides out there, and even the serious memoirist will appreciate the substance beneath its sweet exterior. Taken by themselves, the "remember" cards are less than scintillating (most interesting among them: "Write about a strange family member" and "Write down a story that you tell people that didn't really happen the way you usually tell it"). Pair them with the other cards, however, and you'll soon be writing your memories as conversations among the people involved, or in the form of fairy tales. You'll be asking yourself whether there is a moral to your story, or a sense of drama. "You'll have to find tricks to fool yourself into telling truths you may not wish to reveal to yourself," says the author, Brian Bouldrey, but don't fret if you don't come up with anything deep and dark. "Everything is interesting," Flaubert is quoted as saying here, "if you look at it hard enough." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Brian Bouldrey is the author of five novels. His fiction and essays have appeared in numerous literary publications. He lives in San Francisco.</p><h2>Van Gogh Address Book</h2><p>Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 1853-1890), the eldest son of a Dutch Reformed minister and a bookseller&#39;s daughter, pursued various vocations, including that of an art dealer and clergyman, before deciding to become an artist at the age of 27. Over the course of his decade-long career (1880-90), he produced nearly 900 paintings and more than 1,100 works on paper. Ironically, in 1890, he modestly assessed his artistic legacy as &#34;of very secondary importance.&#34; Included in our address book are reproductions of Van Gogh&#39;s Irises, The Starry Night, Cypresses, and First Steps, After Millet.</p><p>Rivalled by few European musuems the Metropolitan Musuem has the sheer quality and breadth of collection that make it difficult to equal.</p><h2>Chemistry Human Activity, Chemical Reactivity</h2><p>Necessary for CHMA10/11 at UTSc</p><p>With Peter Mahaffy's passion for helping undergraduate students and others see the intricate web that connects chemistry with so many other aspects of life, he has made innovative contributions to science education both in Canada and internationally.

She started her career as a sub-editor for the left-wing journal The Westminster Review, contributing politically charged essays and reviews before turning her attention to novels. Among Eliot&#39;s best-known works are Adam Bede, The Mill on the Floss, Silas Marner, Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, in which she explores aspects of human psychology, focusing on the rural outsider and the politics of small-town life.

Of course my meager, good opinion of everything you have written is a matter of record--and espoused at every opportunity! </p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> Friends! <i>Friends!?</i> How could anyone possibly suspect such a thing?! But I digress. You're certainly welcome to the cover blurb, since it's only accurate. I mean, us being friends and all I probably would have lied for you if I'd needed to, but what the heck? It's always nicer when you can say nice things because they're accurate. Helps add to your reputation for infallibility, you know. </p> <p>Anyway, I've got <i>How Firm a Foundation</i>, which is, what--Safehold #4?--coming out in September. You've got one coming out next month, too, as I recall. So you want to tell me what you're going to do to Walker's crew and their friends this time? </p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson: </strong> I am SOOOOO stoked to read <i>How Firm a Foundation</i>. Most of my reading lately has been old tech manuals, and I need some David Weber! I love how your "Merlin" manages to prod the Safehold tech development along. Artificial being or not, it has to be frustrating to have all that information--that will save lives--running around in his/her head and have to be so careful about revealing it in a logical progression. I'm still improving the "tech" in <i>Firestorm: Destroyermen</i>--which comes out October 4th--but the contrast in how it is applied is fun to compare to the Safehold series. </p> <p> Your "Merlin" knows...everything, but has to hold back while everyone else accepts what is possible, whereas my Destroyermen know what is possible, but don't necessarily know how, or how best to achieve it. Different frustrations. Your guys have to be a lot more careful! Of course the Grik are still there, with their mad Japanese advisor--but the Grik are starting to "get wise" almost in spite of Kurokawa. He gives them technology, but retains his own agenda. Battle will rage on the land, sea, and in the air! </p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> Well, as you know, I "snippet" excerpts of the books on my website, so we're several thousand words into <i>How Firm a Foundation</i>, already. That makes things...interesting from my perspective, since the fans can't wait to start suggesting what my characters should be "inventing" next. I haven't even got steam engines past the proscriptions of the Inquisition yet, and some of these guys seem to think I should already be designing <i>King Edward VII</i>-class, pre-dreadnought battleships! I did just give the Charisians breech-loading caplocks, though. That's going to make life interesting for the other side. And Merlin is about to find out (sort of) what I stashed--I'm sorry, what the <i>Archangel Langhorne</i> stashed--under the Temple. It is a bit darker book, though, since the Church gets in a few licks of its own this time around. Your guys have had that experience, too, I think, haven't they? </p> <p> One thing I'm pondering about is introducing a better propellant than black powder. I'd have to be really careful about that, dealing with the anti-technology proscriptions, but back when Safehold was first settled, the Church did set up the rote preparation and production of fertilizers on a relatively large-scale. It's occurred to me that if I want to introduce nitrocellulose, I might have a platform for that in the fertilizer industry. Or perhaps I should say in the fertilizer pre-industry, since we're not exactly talking about current day DuPont levels of production. What do you think? Practical or would I be stretching things too far? </p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson: </strong> I haven't done "snippets," but I still get a lot of suggestions and speculation on my web site and through direct contacts. I think it's fun and exciting that so many people are thinking about our books. Some of the suggestions are a little strange--okay, sometimes all I can do is just stare--but <i>Destroyermen</i> is a kind of strange story! The contrast between "They couldn't really do that," and "Why don't they have atomic weapons yet?" from one contact to the next can be amusing though. Things take time, particularly when your characters have to find the things to build the things to build the things they need.</p> <p> If you're asking my opinion on propellants, I'd have to suggest sticking with black powder for a while. Your caplock breechloaders will be easy to convert, certainly. I'm converting rifle-muskets to a type of "Allin" breechloader myself. But you can actually get better performance out of black powder in such weapons since they weren't designed (or alloyed and treated) for the higher pressures "smokeless" produces. You'd have to make some major leaps in metallurgy to support jacketed bullets as well, and without them, you're stuck with black powder velocities anyway. Besides, your battles are so much more artistic with plenty of fire and smoke!</p> <p> Of course, then comes logistics! Ha! As you always show so well, getting "new" stuff to the pointy end--and supplying it--is the greatest challenge of all...but then that's pretty fun to write and read about too, isn't it? Wow. I can't wait to be taunted with what you <i>Langhorne</i> stashed! People who know we are friends ask me all the time what "it" is and don't really believe me when I tell them "I don't know!" If I did, I wouldn't rat--and I don't WANT to know until it unfolds on the pages in front of me! </p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> I'm inclined to stick with black powder for small arms for quite a while, for a lot of reasons, including the ones you've mentioned. I'm not too sure about how major a jump I'd have to make to support jacketed bullets--the Safehold-ian tech structure doesn't match up perfectly with any particular, in Earth's history, thanks to all of the "technologies without the science" tucked away in the <i>Holy Writ</i>. That means it wouldn't be beyond the reach of allowable technologies (and Safehold-current techniques) to form copper jackets and then compress the lead into them. I'm inclined to agree with you about the conversion process, and I'm also inclined to think that converting the smokeless powders would also require a drop in caliber, if I want to take advantage of the higher velocities flatter trajectories without beating my poor riflemen to death! </p> <p> I was looking at improved propellants more from the perspective of naval gunnery, field artillery, and shell-fillers (I know, I know--not a "propellant". So sue me!) and that sort of thing. Can't have really long-range gunnery without predictable propellant burn times, and I don't think I can get that kind of quality control out of black powder. At the same time, I have to be thinking in terms of reasonably attainable technologies. And you'd better believe I plan on putting my head together with yours when I actually start converting to cartridges and repeaters! </p> <p> Of course, my life is even more interesting in the next couple of months than yours is, because I [he said, blushing modestly and looking down at his toes] have a new book coming out in October, as well! I finally got around to writing that young adult novel I've wanted to write for so long for Baen's publishing, <i>A Beautiful Friendship</i>, next month. Trust me; it's a very different change of pace from the Safehold books! </p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson:</strong> Oh I know about <i>A Beautiful Friendship</i>, you prolific devil. I've already pre-ordered it too. You're right of course. No real reason why better steels would be proscribed I guess. That's what I meant about jacketed bullets, by the way. Not the bullets themselves, but the barrels that will have to survive them--especially if you increase your rate of fire dramatically! Hehe. Once you eliminate that gas-gushing vent in a muzzle-loader, black powder is amazingly consistent in cartridges--but you still need a whopping heavy (and abusive) bullet to carry your energy along. Flat shooters they ain't. </p> <p> It's no secret that "my" Destroyermen have been working on guncotton and other things. They have the recipe--from that same, valuable little manual we both have!--but the recipe needs a little adjustment when you're not sure what to use for cotton, for example! </p><p> </p><p>Experimentation can be exciting, and a lot of the fun is letting the characters come up with their own angles. Like I've said, as capable as my Destroyermen are, there are a lot of things they don't know how to do, and they often come up with weird, "wrong," but adequate procedures. Also, with their fascination for gizmos, the Lemurians are beginning to come up with some slap your forehead notions and applications that might never have occurred to humans--which begs the question: why did they occur to me? </p> <p> I'm all for juicing up naval artillery--or any artillery at all, as you know--but at sea, particularly, greater range is wasted without some advanced means of fire control. Even rifling won't help much. It's all in the timing, if you know what I mean. Oh, I've got the perfect repeater for you! I can't--actually <i>won't</i> use it--for the same reason I won't use another conversion we discussed, and I would love to see you use (hint). They just wouldn't make sense for my guys and their different starting point. For YOU however...they might even pass the proscriptions!</p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> Oh, yeah. I just finished, like a week or so ago, posting somewhere around a 5,000-word dissertation on the requirements for long-range naval gunnery on the Safehold forum on my website, because some of my readers were wondering how soon the Imperial Charisian Navy is going to go to long-range gunnery, by which some of them seemed to be thinking 20,000 or 30,000 yards. I had to explain that without centralized fire control to make sure all guns fired at exactly the right moment and on the right bearing, without inclinometers to be sure they fired at the right point in the ship's roll, without the ability to predict target movement, without accurate range-finding, and--especially--without predictable and repeatable propellant burn times (not to mention monitoring board erosion, temperature, humidity, propellant temperature, etc.), accurate naval gunnery at anything much over 6,000 yards is going to be problematical at best. I think that sort of "taking things for granted" is part of the price we pay for living at the "user end" of a technological world in the first place, but it starts coming home to you when you do the kind of thing you and I are doing in our books which is trying to build a technological infrastructure from scratch and figuring out how the wheel was invented in the first place!</p> <p> Although, you know, thinking about it, what we're both doing in our different ways that's even more significant than the technology, I think, is looking at the values of the fictitious societies we've created. When you come down to it, technology is just tools -- it's what people do with those tools that distinguishes them from one another. Dark Age mentalities can do terrifying amounts of damage with modern technology. God knows we've seen enough of that in recent years, haven't we? I first came up with the concept for the Safehold books something like twenty years ago, and I've been mostly faithful to that original concept, but I can't pretend it hasn't been modified by things that have happened in the real world since. I actually make an effort to avoid having that happen, but I don't think any author can do that, really. After all, we live in the real world! But what my heroes are doing on Safehold and what your Destroyermen and their allies are doing on your alternate Earth is trying to push back the darkness, and I think that's the real reason a lot of their fans want to know what happens next in both universes. I know I sure do, at any rate!</p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson:</strong> Ha! Few things could be more difficult to comprehend than all the variables that prevent accurate long range naval gunnery. Just figuring out all those variables is hard enough, and then compensating for them all presents an incredibly daunting challenge. The first "modern" computers, in all their complexity, were devoted to just that. Powered torpedoes add even more wild variables. I'll have to read your post to see how you managed to explain it all in a mere 5,000 words! I imagine that if anyone could do it, it would be you! </p> <p> Ultimately however, I couldn't agree with you more; the people <i>are</i> the story. The technology is fun to research, bend to our specific applications, write about, and kick around with each other, but our characters--defined by their character--drive the stories. The "Safehold" and the people who inhabit it, that Nimue Alban's...memories...awoke to was every bit as alien as the world Matt Reddy and his crew of USS Walker encounter in <i>Destroyermen</i>. Both worlds are as remote as they can possibly be to what they knew before, and full of unfamiliar threats and challenges. It is how they--and those around them--deal with their apparently insurmountable obstacles that form the "souls" of each story. Both have a vision for how best to protect and secure the people--and worlds--they have inherited, and both are determined to accomplish their task regardless of the cost, particularly to themselves. In this day and age, it may seem quaint to some that people might be so determined to "do the right thing, as they see it, when nobody is looking," in a sense. But I believe that quality is still admired, and is, I hope, the most resonant chord we have struck with both our tales. </p><p><b>Taylor Anderson</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Destroyermen&nbsp;series.

The heat generated was so intense that a helicopter could only circle at a perimeter of one mile. Flying at a height of 200 feet, the air crew saw that the tongues of flame extended high above the rotor blades. On the surface a converted fishing trawler inched as close as possible, but the paint on the vessel's hull blistered and burnt, and the rope handrails began to smoke. In the water surrounding the inferno, men's heads could be seen bobbing like apples as their yellow hard hats melted with the heat. At the center stood, at least for now, the Piper Alpha oil platform, 110 miles northeast of Aberdeen, once the world's single largest oil producer. On July 6, 1988, its final day, it was ablaze with 226 men onboard. Only sixty-one would survive. <i>Fire in the Night</i> tells, for the first time and in gripping detail, the devastating story of that summer evening. Combining interviews with survivors, witness statements, and transcripts from the official enquiry into the disaster, this is the moving and vivid tale of what happened on that fateful night inside an oil rig inferno.</p></p><p>Stephen McGinty is the author of <i>Churchill's Cigar</i> and <i>This Turbulent Priest: The Life of Cardinal Thomas Winning.</i></p><h2>Thomas and the Fat Controller&#39;s Engines (Railway)</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England.

Rowling herself selected artist Jim Kay, whose over 100 illustrations make this deluxe format as perfect a gift for the child being introduced to the series as for the dedicated fan. Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#39;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#39;t had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.</p><h2>Diagnosing and Treating Co-Dependence: A Guide for Professionals Who Work With Chemical Dependents, Their Spouses, and Children</h2><p><p> A guide for professionals who work with chemical dependents, their spouses and children.

That's what makes the story of 115-year-old global manufacturing and technology leader Emerson so remarkable, and so valuable, for today's managers. How does Emerson do it? And what can other companies learn from its success? Celebrated business leader Charles F. Knight&#x2014;who was CEO of Emerson for 27 of its 43 consecutive years of increased profits&#x2014;says the secret behind Emerson's long-term competitiveness is a dynamic management process carried out with unrelenting discipline. In <i>Performance Without Compromise</i>, Knight breaks down the key components of the Emerson management process in detail for the first time, and shows how this core process enables Emerson to address and overcome major challenges ranging from technological discontinuities to intense global competition. A remarkable success story, <i>Performance Without Compromise</i> is filled with insightful lessons about leadership, management, and competitiveness that can be applied in any company or industry.</p><p><b>Charles F. Knight</b> is Chairman Emeritus of Emerson and serves on the boards of Anheuser-Busch Companies, IBM, and other major corporations. He was CEO of Emerson from 1973 to 2000. <b>Davis Dyer</b> is the author of <i>Rising Tide: Lessons from 165 Years of Brand-Building at P&amp;G</i> (HBS Press, 2004).</p><h2>The Artist Outsider: Creativity and the Boundaries of Culture</h2><p>The text is accompanied by several black and white plates and 12 color plates.</p><p>Though "Outsider Art" has its roots in the Romantic Movement in 19th-century Europe, the term itself was coined 20 years ago to refer to works created by the insane; it has since been broadened to include the unlikely bedfellows of folk, avant-garde, primitive, and modern art. Although ostensibly covering the same topic, these two offerings have little in common. American Self-Taught , by the authors of American Primitive ( LJ 12/88), is a glossy art book presented in a popular style. Each artist--chosen, the authors unabashedly admit, because he or she has an approach that appeals to them personally--is represented by a one-page biography and several works reproduced in lavish color plates. A short introductory essay defines outsider art as "the recovery of a lost world" or, in other words, the harnessing of a primal, often visionary, creative impulse. The contributors to The Artist Outsider , by contrast, spend nearly 300 pages supporting, redefining, and debunking the concept. The book's 19 scholarly essays represent various academic disciplines and are grouped by aesthetic or social approach. They offer an international perspective and critically explore such diverse topics as the role of "insiders" (critics, curators, and dealers), the nature of folk art, the appreciation of difficult art, and art as a tool for the treatment of mental illness. While American Self-Taught is visually thrilling, The Artist Outsider offers provocative food for thought to all who deal with art history. Both are highly recommended for all large art collections; The Artist Outsider is essential for academic collections.<br><i>- Kathleen Eagen Johnson, Historic Hudson Valley, Tarrytown, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arthur&#39;s Prize Reader (I Can Read Level 2)</h2><p><p>Arthur is sure he will win the Super Chimp Comics contest.

We follow a young psychiatrist, Dr Raspe, who enters the profession dreaming of revolutionising its methods. Confronted by day-to-day practices and the reality of life in the psychiatric hospital, Raspe begins to fray at the edges. The very concept of madness is called into question in a brutal portrayal of patients and psychiatrists and the various treatments administered, from psychotherapy to electroshock therapy. What is madness? And who is truly mad? Diving headlong into a terrifying and oppressive world, <i>Insane</i> is a veritable journey into the madhouse by one of Germany&#x2019;s most prominent and contentious authors.</p><p>Rainald Goetz, born in 1954 in Munich, studied History and Medicine in Munich and obtained a doctoral degree in both subjects. He briefly worked as a doctor, but quit this profession for the sake of literature in his early thirties. His first novel, <i>Insane</i>, was published in 1983. In 1998, Goetz wrote the internet diary &#x2018;Rubbish for Everyone&#x2019;, probably the first literary blog in Germany, with entries on the world of media and consumerism. It was published in book form in 1999 and together with <i>Rave</i>, <i>Jeff Koons</i>, <i>Celebration</i> and <i>Deconspiration</i> belongs to <i>This Morning</i>, his great history of the present. Goetz has been awarded numerous prizes, most notably the Georg B�chner Prize in 2015.

He lives in Spain and the United States with the cinema critic Beatriz Leal Riesco.I recognized nothing. <br> Let loose from the madhouse, each day in the evening, I would walk to the tunnels of the U-bahn, not bothering to look around. Had I even caught the scent of spring? Still rattled from the journey, I made my way to my room, and nothing was as it had been before. I stepped oblivious among the beer cans, bottles, newspapers, and bits of clothing on the floor, questing aimlessly. The giant white sheets on the walls, behind the sheets the shelves, on the shelves the books, concealed. Had I read? Had I actually opened a book and heard something other than this pounding, this unbearable pounding in the ears, louder and louder with every phrase? Next to the bed lay the food scraps from the night before. I ate what I could, and fell into a dreamless sleep. I woke, it was already dark, and when I did, the unease was there. Get out of here now, go to the bars, outside. At night when I came back, stumbling and groping, I saw everything sharp and clear. The way the sneaker I kicked off had fallen, landing half on the bread plate. How odd, I thought, and all of the sudden, I came back to myself. <br> But the next morning there was nothing save that pain in my head and a quiver in my hands, and all around me was blindness, bereft of answers. So I set off on my way, back to the madhouse, far again from everything I&#x2019;d known, into a constantly proliferating confusion. <br><br>After the usual wandering through the streets, back and forth on the sidewalk, pressed against the building walls, shop fronts, glass mirrors, aghast at the herds of people packed together in front of, behind, and around him, the ambush of the gazes, but at the same time commanded to be there among the people, in the midst of this back-and-forth, the 39-year-old programmer Sebastian K�hler crossed the broad stretch at one end of the sidewalk with free and easy steps, skipped forward under the linden trees of the opposing street to building 17, oh trusty fa�ade, and with a bellowed HERE I AM set foot into the imposing edifice of the university psychiatric clinic, ready to hand himself over once more.</p><h2>Letters Vita Sackville-W</h2><p>This is a collection of Vita Sackville-West&#39;s letters to Virginia Woolf, assembled with extracts from Virginia&#39;s replies and a linking narrative.

Lewis Signature Classic Range, Lewis addresses the question which tortures every generation -- Why must we suffer? For centuries people have been tormented by one question above all -- &#39;If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his creatures to suffer pain?&#39; And what of the suffering of animals, who neither deserve pain nor can be improved by it? The greatest Christian thinker of our time sets out to disentangle this knotty issue. With his signature wealth of compassion and insight, C.S. Lewis offers answers to these crucial questions and shares his hope and wisdom to help heal a world hungering for a true understanding of human nature.</p><p><i>The Problem of Pain</i> answers the universal question, "Why would an all-loving, all-knowing God allow people to experience pain and suffering?" Master Christian apologist C.S. Lewis asserts that pain is a problem because our finite, human minds selfishly believe that pain-free lives would prove that God loves us. In truth, by asking for this, we want God to love us less, not more than he does. "Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved; that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object is, in that respect at the opposite pole from Love." In addressing "Divine Omnipotence," "Human Wickedness," "Human Pain," and "Heaven," Lewis succeeds in lifting the reader from his frame of reference by artfully capitulating these topics into a conversational tone, which makes his assertions easy to swallow and even easier to digest. Lewis is straightforward in aim as well as honest about his impediments, saying, "I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain hurts. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine that being made perfect through suffering is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my design." The mind is expanded, God is magnified, and the reader is reminded that he is not the center of the universe as Lewis carefully rolls through the dissertation that suffering is God's will in preparing the believer for heaven and for the full weight of glory that awaits him there. While many of us naively wish that God had designed a "less glorious and less arduous destiny" for his children, the fortune lies in Lewis's inclination to set us straight with his charming wit and pious mind. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Why must humanity suffer? In this elegant and thoughtful work, C.S. Lewis questions the pain and suffering that occur everyday and how this contrasts with the notion of a God that is both omnipotent and good -- the answer to this critical theological problem is within these pages.</p><h2>Frontiers of Possession: Spain and Portugal in Europe and the Americas</h2><p><p><i>Frontiers of Possession </i>asks how territorial borders were established in Europe and the Americas during the early modern period and challenges the standard view that national boundaries are largely determined by military conflicts and treaties. Focusing on Spanish and Portuguese claims in the New and Old Worlds, Tamar Herzog reconstructs the different ways land rights were negotiated and enforced, sometimes violently, among people who remembered old possessions or envisioned new ones: farmers and nobles, clergymen and missionaries, settlers and indigenous peoples.</p><p>Questioning the habitual narrative that sees the Americas as a logical extension of the Old World, Herzog portrays Spain and Portugal on both sides of the Atlantic as one unified imperial space. She begins in the Americas, where Iberian conquerors had to decide who could settle the land, who could harvest fruit and cut timber, and who had river rights for travel and trade. The presence of indigenous peoples as enemies to vanquish or allies to befriend, along with the vastness of the land, complicated the picture, as did the promise of unlimited wealth. In Europe, meanwhile, the formation and re-formation of boundaries could last centuries, as ancient entitlements clashed with evolving economic conditions and changing political views and juridical doctrines regarding how land could be acquired and maintained.</p><p>Herzog demonstrates that the same fundamental questions had to be addressed in Europe and in the Americas. Territorial control was always subject to negotiation, as neighbors and outsiders, in their quotidian interactions, carved out and defended new frontiers of possession.</p></p><p>Tamar Herzog is Monroe Gutman Professor of Latin American Affairs and Radcliffe Alumnae Professor in the History Department at Harvard University, and Affiliated Faculty Member at Harvard Law School.&#x201c;Herzog succeeds in her aim of moving beyond the usually separate histories of Spain and Portugal&#x2015;and of Europe and the Americas&#x2015;to complicate the accepted understanding of national and imperial boundaries as immutable facts rather than as ongoing sites of contestation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William O&#x2019;Connor</b><b>, </b><b><i>Daily Beast</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book is about as thorough a research work as this reviewer has ever encountered...

They are usually referred to as Ascomycetes and are commonly found and collected by mushroom enthusiasts. Ascomycetes exhibit a remarkable range of biodiversity, are beautiful and visually complex, and some, including morels and truffles, are highly prized for their edibility. Many play significant roles in plant ecology because of the mycorrhizal associations that they form. Thus it is remarkable that no book dedicated to describing and illustrating the North American Ascomycetes has been published in over sixty years.</p><p>Filling the gap between technical publications and the limited representation of Ascomycetes in general mushroom field guides, <i>Ascomycete Fungi of North America</i> is a scientifically accurate work dedicated to this significant group of fungi. Because it is impossible to describe and illustrate the tens of thousands of species that occur in North America, the authors focus on species found in the continental United States and Canada that are large enough to be readily noticeable to mycologists, naturalists, photographers, and mushroom hunters. They provide 843 color photographs and more than 600 described species, many of which are illustrated in color for the first time. While emphasizing macroscopic field identification characteristics for a general audience, the authors also include microscopic and other advanced information useful to students and professional mycologists. In addition, a color key to the species described in this book offers a visual guide to assist in the identification process.</p></p><p>MICHAEL W.

And there is no book for North America with good photographs. This book will be welcomed by amateur mycologists worldwide and will be useful for professional mycologists as well.

As the back cover explains, What is a senryu?/A funny poem that is/Almost haiku-ckoo. On the title page, readers find a youngster in pursuit of a renegade ball (a metaphor for the poetic style). It takes the boy down a ladder, below ground to a wacky parallel universe where everything familiar is turned upside down. As the chase continues, a series of delightful poems describes this strange world. The highly spirited verses feature witty wordplay and puns: My older sister/gets a complete makeover /<i>very</i> mascary! or On Ferris wheel/I regret French fries, milk shake /those below agree. Finally, the ball disappears into a giant poet-tree. A few of the offerings may not have the same layered meaning for youngsters as they do for adults; for example, an insect photographer introduces himself as a shutterbug. Still, this book fulfills its purpose to revive and invigorate the language, and does so with humor. In her ink-and-watercolor cartoons, Tusa uses a soft palette, strong lines, and abundant white space to define the comical characters. Her artwork is a marvelous vehicle to increase children's visual literacy while complementing these zany and memorable verses.

They&#x2019;re coming!&#x2019; <p></p>He had pushed her all the way to the front door now. She&#x2019;d seen him pretty strung out before, but never this bad. A fix would help him, she knew it would. And she knew, too, that he had the makings upstairs in his bedroom. The sweat trickled from his chilled rat&#x2019;s-tails of hair. Only two minutes ago, the most important decision in her life had been whether or not to dare a trip to the squat&#x2019;s seething lavatory. But now&#x2026;. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x2019; he repeated, his voice a whisper now. &#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re scaring me.&#x2019; <p></p>He stared at her, his eyes seeming almost to recognise her. Then he looked away again, into a distance all of his own. The word was a snakelike hiss. <p></p>&#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; And with that he yanked open the door. It was raining outside, and she hesitated. But then fear took her, and she made to cross the threshold. But his hand grabbed at her arm, pulling her back inside. He embraced her, his sweat sea-salty, his body throbbing. His mouth was close to her ear, his breath hot. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve murdered me,&#x2019; he said. Then with sudden ferocity he pushed her again, and this time she was outside, and the door was slamming shut, leaving him alone in the house. Alone with himself. She stood on the garden path, staring at the door, trying to decide whether to knock or not. <p></p>It wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. She knew that. So instead she started to cry. Her head slipped forward in a rare show of self-pity and she wept for a full minute, before, breathing hard three times, she turned and walked quickly down the garden path (such as it was). Someone would take her in. Someone would comfort her and take away the fear and dry her clothes. <p></p>Someone always did. <p></p>JOHN REBUS stared hard at the dish in front of him, oblivious to the conversation around the table, the background music, the flickering candles. He didn&#x2019;t really care about house prices in Barnton, or the latest delicatessen to be opened in the Grassmarket. He didn&#x2019;t much want to speak to the other guests&#x2014;a female lecturer to his right, a male bookseller to his left&#x2014;about&#x2026; well, what ever they&#x2019;d just been discussing. Yes, it was the perfect dinner party, the conversation as tangy as the starter course, and he was glad Rian had invited him. Of course he was. But the more he stared at the half lobster on his plate, the more an unfocussed despair grew within him. What had he in common with these people? Would they laugh if he told the story of the police alsatian and the severed head? No, they would not. They would smile politely, then bow their heads towards their plates, acknowledging that he was&#x2026; well, <i>different</i> from them. <p></p>&#x2018;Vegetables, John?&#x2019; <p></p>It was Rian&#x2019;s voice, warning him that he was not &#x2018;taking part&#x2019;, was not &#x2018;conversing&#x2019; or even looking interested. He accepted the large oval dish with a smile, but avoided her eyes. <p></p>She was a nice girl. Quite a stunner in an individual sort of way. Bright red hair, cut short and pageboyish. Eyes deep, striking green. Lips thin but promising. Oh yes, he liked her. He wouldn&#x2019;t have accepted her invitation otherwise. He fished about in the dish for a piece of broccoli that wouldn&#x2019;t break into a thousand pieces as he tried to manoeuvre it onto his plate. <p></p>&#x2018;Gorgeous food, Rian,&#x2019; said the bookseller, and Rian smiled, accepting the remark, her face reddening slightly. That was all it took, John. That was all you had to say to make this girl happy. But in his mouth he knew it would come out sounding sarcastic. His tone of voice was not something he could suddenly throw off like a piece of clothing. It was a part of him, nurtured over a course of years. So when the lecturer agreed with the bookseller, all John Rebus did was smile and nod, the smile too fixed, the nod going on a second or two too long, so that they were all looking at him again. The piece of broccoli snapped into two neat halves above his plate and splattered onto the tablecloth. <p></p>&#x2018;Shite!&#x2019; he said, knowing as the word escaped his lips that it was not quite appropriate, not quite the <i>right</i> word for the occasion. Well, what was he, a man or a thesaurus? <p></p>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t be helped,&#x2019; said Rian. My God, her voice was cold. <p></p>It was the perfect end to a perfect weekend. He&#x2019;d gone shopping on Saturday, ostensibly for a suit to wear tonight. But had baulked at the prices, and bought some books instead, one of which was intended as a gift to Rian: <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. But then he&#x2019;d decided he&#x2019;d like to read it himself first, and so had brought flowers and chocolates instead, forgetting her aversion to lilies ( <i>had he known in the first place?</i>) and the diet she was in the throes of starting. Damn. And to cap it all, he&#x2019;d tried a new church this morning, another Church of Scotland offering, not too far from his flat. The last one he&#x2019;d tried had seemed unbearably cold, promising nothing but sin and repentance, but this latest church had been the oppressive opposite: all love and joy and what was there to forgive anyway? So he&#x2019;d sung the hymns, then buggered off, leaving the minister with a handshake at the door and a promise of future attendance. <p></p>&#x2018;More wine, John?&#x2019; <p></p>This was the bookseller, proffering the bottle he&#x2019;d brought himself. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad little wine, actually, but the bookseller had talked about it with such unremitting pride that Rebus felt obliged to decline. The man frowned, but then was cheered to find this refusal left all the more for himself. He replenished his glass with vigour. <p></p>&#x2018;Cheers,&#x2019; he said. <p></p>The conversation returned to how busy Edinburgh seemed these days. Here was something with which Rebus could agree. This being the end of May, the tourists were almost in season. But there was more to it than that. If anyone had told him five years ago that in 1989 people would be emigrating north from the south of England to the Lothians, he&#x2019;d have laughed out loud. Now it was fact, and a fit topic for the dinner table. <p></p>Later, much later, the couple having departed, Rebus helped Rian with the dishes. <p></p>&#x2018;What was wrong with you?&#x2019; she said, but all he could think about was the minister&#x2019;s handshake, that confident grip which bespoke assurances of an afterlife. <p></p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s leave these till morning.&#x2019; <p></p>Rian stared at the kitchen, counting the used pots, the half-eaten lobster carcasses, the wine glasses smudged with grease. <p></p>&#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;What did you have in mind instead?&#x2019; <p></p>He raised his eyebrows slowly, then brought them down low over his eyes. His lips broadened into a smile which had about it a touch of the leer. She became coy. <p></p>&#x2018;Why, Inspector,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Is that supposed to be some kind of a clue?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s another,&#x2019; he said, lunging at her, hugging her to him, his face buried in her neck. She squealed, clenched fists beating against his back. <p></p>&#x2018;Police brutality!&#x2019; she gasped. &#x2018;Help! Police, help!&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Yes, madam?&#x2019; he inquired, carrying her by the waist out of the kitchen, towards where the bedroom and the end of the weekend waited in shadow. <p></p>LATE EVE NING at a building site on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The contract was for the construction of an office development. A fifteen-foot-high fence separated the works from the main road. The road, too, was of recent vintage, built to help ease traffic congestion around the city. Built so that commuters could travel easily from their countryside dwellings to jobs in the city centre. <p></p>There were no cars on the road to night. The only sound came from the slow chug-chugging of a cement mixer on the site. A man was feeding it spadefuls of grey sand and remembering the far distant days when he had laboured on a building site. Hard graft it had been, but honest. <p></p>Two other men stood above a deep pit, staring down into it. &#x2018;Should do it,&#x2019; one said. <p></p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; the other agreed. They began walking back to the car, an ageing purple Mercedes. <p></p>&#x2018;He must have some clout. I mean, to get us the keys to this place, to set all this up. Some clout.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ours is not to ask questions, you know that.&#x2019; The man who spoke was the oldest of the three, and the only Calvinist. He opened the car boot. Inside, the body of a frail teenager lay crumpled, obviously dead. His skin was the colour of pencil shading, darkest where the bruises lay. <p></p>&#x2018;What a waste,&#x2019; said the Calvinist. <p></p>&#x2018;Aye,&#x2019; the other agreed. Together they lifted the body from the boot, and carried it gently towards the hole. It dropped softly to the bottom, one leg wedging up against the sticky clay sides, a trouser leg slipping to show a naked ankle. <p></p>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; the Calvinist said to the cement man. &#x2018;Cover it, and let&#x2019;s get out of here. I&#x2019;m starving.&#x2019; <p></p>Excerpted from Hide And Seek by IAN RANKIN. <p></p>Copyright � 1990 by Ian Rankin. <p></p>Published in 1990 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

He lives in Incline Village, Nevada.Even the most ardent pacifists may run for their guns after considering the ease with which America's cities are terrorized in the latest by Air Force veteran Brown (Chains of Command, 1993, etc.). Admiral Ian Hardcastle tirelessly warns Americans of their vulnerability to terrorist attacks in the illusory calm of the postCold War climate. His extreme warnings prove justified when Henri Cazaux, who was once tortured and sodomized by American soldiers stationed in his native Belgium, gets hold of an airplane and uses it to drop a large amount of explosives on Los Angeles International Airport, wreaking death and destruction after a thrilling chase by F-16 fighter jets. This incineration is so easy that he targets more airports around the country, enlisting (i.e., coercing) into his service his investment banker, his Colombian and British advisers, and numerous mercenaries, all of whom would die for Cazaux, not out of loyalty but out of fear of death at his hand should they fail. A multidepartmental task force assembles in Washington, but that damn Democratic administration just won't listen to military men like Hardcastle, learning its lesson only when Cazaux's master plan--an air/surface assault on Washington, DC--threatens our most treasured national monuments. Brown has mastered this genre, as seen in the riveting plane chases and the ease and humor with which he vents his own political frustrations: His parody of Bill and Hillary Clinton will amuse all partisans, but his contempt for modern women, placed here in positions of power but too incompetent to be of use, achieves misogyny with Cazaux's rape of his psychic, whose incredible response makes a mockery of real violence against women. Super chase scenes that don't let up until the planes run out of fuel or blow up, and a perfect villain who refuses to be exterminated until the last page. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When the bones of a twelve-year-old boy are found scattered in the Hollywood Hills, Harry Bosch is drawn into a case that brings up the darkest memories from his own haunted past. The bones have been buried for years, but the cold case doesn&#39;t deter Bosch. Unearthing hidden stories, he finds the child&#39;s identity and reconstructs his fractured life, determined that he not be forgotten. At the same time, a new love affair with a female cop begins to blossom for Bosch - until a stunningly blown mission leaves him in more trouble than ever before in his turbulent career. The investigation races to a shocking conclusion and leaves Bosch on the brink of an unimaginable decision.</p><p>Since his first appearance in 1992's Edgar-winning <i>The Black Echo</i>, Detective Hieronymous "Harry" Bosch has joined Dennis Lehane's Patrick and Angie, George Pelecanos's Derek Strange, and Greg Rucka's Atticus Kodiak in the pantheon of new-school hard-boiled detectives. Rather than giving Bosch a clever gimmick (like Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme, who is a quadriplegic), Michael Connelly embraces the noir archetype: Bosch, an L.A. homicide detective, is a chain-smoking loner who refuses to play by his superiors' rules. Although he has quit smoking, Harry's still the same tightlipped outsider, taking each crime as a personal affront as he tries to cleanse his beloved city of the darkness he sees engulfing it. <p> In <i>City of Bones</i>, Connelly's eighth Bosch title, Bosch and his well-dressed partner, Jerry Edgar, are working to identify a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years in the forest off Hollywood's Wonderland Drive, and to bring the killer to belated justice. For Bosch this is more than just another homicide, as the mystery child, beaten and abandoned, comes to represent much of what he sees as evil in his city. Add in a tragic love affair with a fellow cop, complications from overzealous media, and the growing feeling that he's fighting a losing battle about which no one cares, and the usually stoic Bosch is pushed to his limits. This isn't the strongest plot Connelly has concocted for Bosch, but it leads to an ending the whole series has been building toward. The conclusion may not shock longtime fans, but it will leave them wondering where the series will go from here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>A former police reporter for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Connelly is the author of seven acclaimed Harry Bosch novels: The Black Echo, The Black Ice, The Concrete Blonde, The Last Coyote, Trunk Music, Angels Flight, and A Darkness More Than Night, as well as The Poet, Blood Work and Void Moon. He lives in Los Angeles.</p><h2>The Quilter&#39;s Kitchen: An Elm Creek Quilts Novel With Recipes (Thorndike Press Large Print Core Series)</h2><p>Anna Del Maso had known that she wanted to be a chef since she was in the seventh grade. "Somehow everything in my life ends up being about food," she realizes, as she begins the latest of her food-themed quilts. Her twin passions have converged in a brand-new position as head chef for Elm Creek Quilts, Waterford, Pennsylvania's popular quilting retreat. <p> As she joins the circle of quilters at historic Elm Creek Manor, Anna is eager to preserve the manor's culinary heritage, dating to 1858, while also celebrating the new favorites of their many guests. Yet as Master Quilter Sylvia Bergstrom Compson well knows, the manor's kitchen, last updated in the 1940s, can't create food that compares to the state-of-the-art quilting instruction for which Elm Creek Quilts is renowned. </p><p> A full renovation of the kitchen must be completed by the start of the new camp season. Though the task is daunting, Anna is assured in her belief that "A kitchen is the heart of a home." As she and Sylvia begin to dismantle the old to make way for the new, Sylvia's reminiscences remind them both of just how many of the manor's traditions have involved food and celebrations. Whether the feast is one of the holiday menus prepared and enjoyed by generations of Bergstroms, or one of the Welcome Banquets and Farewell Breakfasts that have become hallmarks of Elm Creek Quilt Camp, there is a story for every recipe, and a recipe for every story. </p><p> <i>The Quilter's Kitchen</i> follows Anna's flavorful explorations of the kitchens of Elm Creek Manor, past and present. As she records beloved recipes and creates original dishes seasoned with love, she discovers anew how the gifts of the table gather friends and family ever closer.</p></p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and several historical fiction novels. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, she lives with her husband and sons in Madison, Wisconsin.

"Maybe when we're finished remodeling the kitchen," she said, voice shaking with each bump and jolt, "we can convince Sylvia to do something about this road."</p><p>Jeremy kept his eyes on the winding way that led into the forest; if a car approached from the opposite direction, he would have to react quickly and pull halfway off the road to avoid a collision. Both sides of his car were already marked with fine scratches from past diversions into the underbrush. "I doubt it," he replied, his wire-rimmed glasses sliding down his nose a millimeter or two with every pothole. "Sylvia's a traditionalist. The longer you know her, the more you'll realize that she's reluctant to alter the old family estate too much."</p><p>"She's letting me make big changes to the kitchen," Anna reminded him.</p><p>Jeremy shrugged and offered her his familiar cheerful, crooked grin. "Only because she didn't think you'd take the job otherwise."</p><p>As much as Anna was thrilled with her new position as Elm Creek Manor's chef, she had to admit that Sylvia had guessed correctly. She would never forget her first glimpse of the kitchen when she had come to the manor for her job interview. It was larger than she expected to find in a building constructed in 1858, but there was not a single appliance post-1945 except for a tiny microwave on the counter, possibly the first ever invented by the look of it. The pantry was spacious and well stocked, but poorly lit and so badly organized that it would have taken Anna longer to find ingredients for one of her signature dishes than to mix them together. And as for the cooking utensils left to soak in the sink...The whisk looked to be at least fifty years old, which wouldn't have bothered her had it not been bent out of shape, and the hand mixer had rust, actual rust, on the handle. How the Elm Creek Quilters had managed to feed fifty-plus people three meals a day with that four-burner gas stove was a mystery, but Anna knew that she couldn't work in such conditions, not after being spoiled by the sparkling clean, modern facilities at Waterford College. Fortunately Sylvia had agreed that the kitchen was long overdue for an upgrade, and she had accepted Anna's condition for taking the job.</p><p>Now that Elm Creek Quilt Camp had ended for the season, Sylvia and Anna would launch the remodeling process in earnest. With weeks of planning and hours of consultation behind them, in two days they would usher in a team of workmen to tear out old cupboards and haul away dilapidated appliances, to demolish the wall between the kitchen and the west sitting room, to install new wiring, lighting, shelving, appliances, and everything else Anna desired and Sylvia's budget would allow. If all went well, Anna would have a fully operational, professional kitchen in time for the holiday feasts she intended to prepare for her new colleagues.</p><p>She hoped, in time, that they would become her friends.</p><p>Late-morning sunlight broke through the leafy wood, gold and rust and scarlet with autumn, as the road forked, wound through the trees, and emerged beside a sunlit apple orchard. They passed a red barn, climbed a low hill, and crossed the bridge over Elm Creek. All at once the manor came into view -- three stories of gray stone and dark wood surrounded by autumnal beauty.</p><p>Anna knew the Elm Creek Quilters considered the grand manor a second home. She was an Elm Creek Quilter now, too, she reminded herself. Perhaps in time Elm Creek Manor would become as important to her as it was to her new coworkers.</p><p>On the other side of the creek, the road broadened into a parking lot that circled two towering elms. "Call me when you want me to pick you up," Jeremy offered as he parked near the foot of the back stairs.</p><p>"I can take the bus," Anna said. She couldn't help feeling as if she were imposing on his generosity. It was one thing for him to drive her to work when his girlfriend, Summer, had lived at the manor, but now that Summer was attending graduate school in Chicago, Jeremy had no reason to come so far out of his way. Anna and Jeremy were friends and neighbors, with apartments on opposite sides of the hall in a building not far from the Waterford College campus, but these almost daily drives were a lot to ask even of a friend. But every time Anna mentioned the bus, Jeremy shook his head and drove her anyway. Anna suspected that Summer had asked him to bring her since she was new, to help her feel less like an outsider. Or maybe the Elm Creek Quilters were afraid that she would grow tired of the long walk from the bus stop, and they had enlisted Jeremy's help to make sure she didn't wear out her shoes. Or maybe Jeremy was just a nice guy and she was taking advantage of him.</p><p>Whatever the reason, and despite the occasional pang of guilt, secretly Anna was glad that their carpooling had not ended with Summer's departure. The bus's circuitous route would have added two hours to her daily commute, and she would have missed Jeremy's company.</p><p>"I'll have my cell on," Jeremy said, as if she had not mentioned the bus this time, either. Surely Summer had asked him to babysit her. That had to be it.</p><p>Anna returned Jeremy's grin, waved good-bye, and climbed the four stone steps to the back door of Elm Creek Manor. The kitchen was through the first doorway on the left, and from within came the sound of someone clattering pots and pans and what sounded like cookie sheets.</p><p>Anna hung her jacket in the hall closet and entered the kitchen, which already seemed strangely bare with the long wooden table and the benches that usually flanked it missing. Clad in a burgundy cardigan and black slacks, her silver-gray hair held back in a tortoise-shell comb, Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, Master Quilter and founder of Elm Creek Quilts, sat cross-legged on the floor, transferring skillets and saucepans into a carton. She glanced up and smiled, feathery lines etched around her eyes and mouth deepening, but the fondness in her expression did not lessen her air of command, as if she were a woman who was accustomed to voicing her opinions and having others carefully listen.</p><p>"Matt and Andrew moved the table and benches into the dining room, out of the way," Sylvia said, answering Anna's unspoken question. Brushing dust from her hands, she rose, far more slender than Anna and nearly as tall, with only the slightest stoop to her shoulders. A pair of glasses hung around her neck on a silver chain. "I haven't decided what to do with them yet. They'll seem out of place in our new kitchen, and yet they've been in the family so long I can't bear to get rid of them."</p><p>"I'm sure we can find a place for them somewhere," said Anna. "We don't have to get rid of everything, not if it's useful or has sentimental value.""</p><p>You're thinking just like my Bergstrom ancestors," said Sylvia dryly. "Remind me to show you the attic someday. No, we can't keep everything. That's the whole point of our work today, isn't it, to clear out the old and make way for the new?"</p><p>Anna hesitated. "I thought we were just going to pack up the dishes and cookware and move everything out of the way before the contractor demolishes the cabinets. I assumed we'd put everything back afterward."</p><p>"And spoil your lovely new kitchen with rusty old pots and pans?" Sylvia shook her head. "Out of the question."</p><p>"Sometimes old pots cook better than new," said Anna, thinking of the cast-iron cookware she had long admired. She was itching to cook up a ratatouille in the Dutch oven that had belonged to Sylvia's great-aunt. "Let's not discard things arbitrarily just because they clash with the paint and granite."</p><p>Sylvia smiled, amused by Anna's reference to their many contentious debates with their contractor's designer, who held strong opinions about the merits of particular color combinations. "Agreed. If I want to toss something out but you want to keep it, I'll let you have the last word. This kitchen will be your workspace, after all."</p><p>"But it's more than that," Anna said. "A kitchen is the heart of a home. Think of how much time the Elm Creek Quilters spend in this room, discussing quilt patterns and lesson plans over coffee and cake. Your guests, too. In the few weeks I've been here, I've noticed that time and time again, quilt campers find their way to the kitchen."</p><p>"They follow their noses," Sylvia said. "More so than ever since you came on board."</p><p>"It's also the first room campers pass when they come through the back door," Anna added, "and except for registration morning, that's the door they use most frequently."</p><p>Sylvia nodded, thoughtful. "It never occurred to me, but perhaps the kitchen is just as important as the front foyer is for offering our guests a warm welcome to the manor."</p><p>In Anna's opinion, the kitchen played that role in every home. "We could always move the registration tables in here," she joked as she knelt beside a lower cabinet. Inside she found cake pans of all shapes and sizes, definitely worth keeping. She pulled over an empty carton and carefully stacked the pans within it.</p><p>"Even after we knock out the wall and expand into the sitting room, we won't have enough space for that," said Sylvia. "Our campers will have to wait until the Welcome Banquet to get an official greeting from your kitchen."</p><p>The Welcome Banquet: the eagerly anticipated commencement of each new week of camp. The banquet hall, transformed by white linen tablecloths, crystal, and candlelight, set the proper festive tone for the days ahead, a week devoted to learning, sharing, and enjoying a respite from the cares of ordinary life. Anna had prepared the delicious feast for the last few weeks of the camp season, and she had been delighted by the campers' rave reviews -- not to mention those of the Elm Creek Quilters. She was pleased to know that she played such an important role i...</p></p><h2>Making Indian Bows and Arrows, The Old Way</h2><p>This exciting Eagle's View edition includes all you need to know to make powerful and attractive Native American bows with an easy-to-follow text together with numerous illustrations and photos.

One of these, considered the definitive text of the Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra school of Buddhism, is the encyclopedic synthesis of Mahayana Buddhist doctrines and practices known as the <i>Yog&#x101;c&#x101;rabh&#x16b;mi,</i> or "Stages of Spiritual Practice." The <i>Bodhisattvabh&#x16b;mi</i>, or "Stages of the Bodhisattva Path," is one portion of that massive work, though it is considered a stand-alone text in the Tibetan traditions--for example, it is counted among the six core texts of the Kadampas. However, despite the text's centrality to the Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra school and its seminal importance in the Tibetan traditions, it has remained unavailable in English except in piecemeal translations; Engle's translation will therefore be especially welcomed by scholars and students alike.</p><p>ASANGA was a fourth-century Indian adept and philosopher, author of the foundational works of the Yog&#x101;c&#x101;ra school of Buddhist philosophy. ARTEMUS B. ENGLE received a PhD in Buddhist studies from the University of Wisconsin and has studied Tibetan Buddhism for more than forty years. He teaches Tibetan language and Buddhist doctrine at the Mahayana Sutra and Tantra Center in Howell, New Jersey, and has published numerous translations of works by Indian and Tibetan masters. He has been a Tsadra Foundation Fellow since 2005."Art Engle's translation of Asa&#x1e47;ga's monumental Bodhisattva Stage is a major work of excellent scholarship&#x2014;presented in a way that is also useful to practitioners. It is truly impressive and remarkable, the fine job he has done with this seminal and rather difficult work. Anyone who aspires to follow the way of the bodhisattva, the whole-hearted altruist who undertakes the evolutionary path through countless lives toward the perfectly blissful enlightenment of buddhahood, is well-advised to study this work in all its sparkling detail.

British men and women left their homes and traveled to this mysterious, beautiful country-where they attempted to replicate their own society. In this fascinating portrait, Margaret MacMillan examines the hidden lives of the women who supported their husbands&#39; conquests-and in turn supported the Raj, often behind the scenes and out of the history books. Enduring heartbreaking separations from their families, these women had no choice but to adapt to their strange new home, where they were treated with incredible deference by the natives but found little that was familiar. The women of the Raj learned to cope with the harsh Indian climate and ward off endemic diseases; they were forced to make their own entertainment-through games, balls, and theatrics-and quickly learned to abide by the deeply ingrained Anglo-Indian love of hierarchy. Weaving interviews, letters, and memoirs with a stunning selection of illustrations, MacMillan presents a vivid cultural and social history of the daughters, sisters, mothers, and wives of the men at the center of a daring imperialist experiment-and reveals India in all its richness and vitality.</p><p><b> MARGARET MacMILLAN </b> is the renowned author of <i>Women of the Raj, </i>Stephen Leacock (Extraordinary Canadians series), and the international bestsellers <i>Nixon in China </i>and <i>Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World, </i>which won the 2003 Governor General&#x2019;s Award and the 2002 Samuel Johnson Prize. She is also the author of <i>The Uses and Abuses of History. </i>The past provost of Trinity College at the University of Toronto, she is now the warden of St. Antony&#x2019;s College at Oxford University.<b>Chapter 1<br></b><br><b>The Voyage Out</b><br><br>Englishwomen&#x2014;and Welsh and Scots and Irish women&#x2014;had been going to India for generations by the time the Raj reached its peak in the late nineteenth century. The first to make the voyage may have been a Mrs. Hudson and her maid, Frances Webb, who went in 1617 as companions to an Armenian lady who had been born in India. (Frances had a love affair on the voyage, unwittingly setting the pattern for countless women who came after her.) Over the years, India drew a few women looking for work&#x2014;as milliners, perhaps, or governesses. And some women had a calling to be missionaries. Others simply went because they had been summoned back by their families after an education in Britain.<br><br>The great majority, however, went to India because their husbands were there or because they hoped to find husbands for themselves. (To keep them chaste for the marriage market, unmarried women traveled, until well into the twentieth century, under the care of chaperones, usually married women who were making the voyage anyway.) The &#x201c;fishing fleet,&#x201d; as it was known unkindly but accurately by the nineteenth century, arrived in India in the autumn at the start of the cold weather. One lady who came out in 1779 divided what she called &#x201c;the speculative ladies&#x201d; into old maids, &#x201c;of the shrivelled and dry description,&#x201d; and girls, &#x201c;educated merely to cover the surface of their mental deformity.&#x201d; The odds were that their fishing would meet success: throughout the period of British rule in India, European men outnumbered European women by about three to one.<br><br>Understandably, few British women had cared to come to the unsettled India of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; and, what is more, the early charters of the East India Company pointedly forbade women on its posts. Its employees ignored that regulation as they did so many others. They took Indian mistresses; worse, from the point of view of the Company&#x2019;s staunch Protestant directors, they married Catholics, daughters or widows of the Portuguese. To save the souls of its men, the Company, for a time, played matchmaker. In the later part of the seventeenth century it shipped batches of young women from Britain to India. The cargo, divided into &#x201c;gentlewomen&#x201d; and &#x201c;others,&#x201d; were given one set of clothes each and were supported for a year&#x2014;quite long enough, it was thought, for them to find themselves husbands. Some did not; and the Company tried to deny that it had any obligation to look after them further. Most unfairly it also warned them to mind their morals: &#x201c;Whereas some of these women are grown scandalous to our nation, religion and Government interest,&#x201d; said a letter from London to the Deputy Governor of Bombay in 1675, &#x201c;we require you to give them fair warning that they do apply themselves to a more sober and Christian conversation.&#x201d; If that warning did not have the right effect, the women were to be fed on bread and water and shipped back to Britain. The experiment was not a happy one and it must have been with relief that the Company abandoned the practice in the eighteenth century. British women still traveled to India but they came individually.<br><br>The voyage was a dreadful one. The wooden sailing vessels, tiny by today&#x2019;s standards, were tossed about in every storm&#x2014;and the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean were famous for their storms. The passengers faced at best being thrown about in their cabins, at worst drowning. The Reverend Hobart Caunter recorded one such storm, which took place off the east coast of India in the 1830s. The weather began to turn foul early one morning. &#x201c;The only lady among us every now and then expressed her fears, when a sudden gust caused the vessel to lurch with an increased momentum, as if the billows were already commencing a fiercer conflict.&#x201d; By late afternoon, they were in the midst of a full-blown hurricane. The ship pitched violently and furniture was torn from its fastenings. More dangerously, a cannon got loose and threatened to batter a hole in the side. Even Caunter, a seasoned traveler, found the noise, coupled with the crashing of waves and the howling of the wind, &#x201c;painful in the extreme.&#x201d; Night came on and the storm increased in fury. As Caunter and the captain were in the main cabin, or cuddy, trying to carry on a conversation, &#x201c;suddenly, a heavy sea struck her astern, but happily on the quarter, and in an instant carried away the quarter-galley on that side, swamping the cabin into which the poor lady before spoken of had retired for the night. The force of the water was so great, that it dashed open the door of the cabin, and its fair occupant was borne head foremost into the cuddy, dripping like a mermaid, her hair hanging about her shoulders in thin strips, when she was rescued by the captain from further mischief. She was drenched to the skin.&#x201d;<br><br>At its shortest the voyage under sail took under two months; at its longest well over six. Sometimes the winds were so contrary on the west coast of Africa that the ships were blown off course almost to Brazil. The crew and passengers gasped with the heat; then, when they were rounding the Cape of Good Hope, they shivered in the cold. There was the danger of being dashed against the shore by a sudden shift in the winds. Those who survived often ended up in the great slave markets along the east coast of Africa. Occasionally the winds might fail altogether and the unhappy ship would sit becalmed for weeks on end.<br><br>Accommodations were cramped and dirty and often had to be shared with huge rats which scurried about, boldly eating any food that was left out and nibbling holes in clothing. Women who could afford it had cabins abovedecks. Otherwise they were housed below, in stuffy cubbyholes, often with walls made of canvas, where they had very little privacy. A bucket of salt water was the closest passengers got to a wash tub; another bucket made do for a toilet. Mrs. Sherwood, later famous as a writer of sentimental children&#x2019;s stories, accompanied her army officer husband out to India at the beginning of the nineteenth century; she had to sleep in a hammock strung above a cannon while filthy water from the bilges ran across the floor beneath.<br><br>Mrs. Eliza Fay, who lived in India in the late eighteenth century, endured the voyage several times. Fortunately she was a woman who faced difficulties (and she had many&#x2014;from imprisonment by an Indian ruler to her wastrel of a husband) in an optimistic spirit. Her letters to her sister are filled with cheerful gossip and appalling details of shipboard life. On one voyage back to England, she nearly suffocated. &#x201c;The port of my cabin being kept almost constantly shut, and the door opening into the steerage; I had neither light nor air but from a scuttle.&#x201d; On her first voyage the captain was &#x201c;overbearing and insolent&#x201d; and kept his passengers half starved. At meals, Mrs. Fay reported proudly, &#x201c;the longest arm fared best; and you cannot imagine what a good scrambler I am become.&#x201d;<br><br>When they could, women on the sailing ships escaped from their cabins to the fresh air of the deck, but that depended on both the weather and the mood of the captain. Many of the captains of the East Indiamen were quite charmingly eccentric on dry land; at sea they seemed half mad and one of their more common phobias was women. Ladies were often forced to take their meals in their cabins rather than in the cuddy because the gentlemen drank and swore so dreadfully. Mrs. Sherwood confided to her diary that &#x201c;those who have not been at sea can never conceive the hundredth part of the horrors of a long voyage to a female in a sailing vessel.&#x201d;<br><br>At the start of the voyage, there might be the luxury of fresh meat, because many ships carried cows and sheep on deck. Sooner or later, rations would get shorter, the preserved meat tougher and saltier. Water would turn the color of strong tea, with a foul smell and an even fouler taste. Minnie Blane, a happy, sheltered young middle- class girl from Bath, experienced all the unpleasantness of sailing ships when she traveled out to India in 1856 with her husband, an officer in the Indian Army. (They might have taken the shorter route overland via Egypt and enjoyed the relative comfort of steamships but her husband needed to save money.) Minnie, who was pregnant, was sick a good deal of the time and the meals she faced cannot have helped. For weeks on end, after they had rounded the Cape, the only meat was &#x201c;Pork, boiled, roasted, fried, chops, curry (with so much garlic in it, it is quite uneatable), and one leg of mutton, half raw.&#x201d; The butter was thick with salt and sugar had long since run out. Some food was quite rotten. &#x201c;I cannot tell you,&#x201d; wrote Minnie to her mother, &#x201c;how sick it made me one day, on cutting open a fig, to see three or four large white maggots lying comfortably inside!&#x201d; Cautious travelers often took a private stock of food and wine. Many women brought other little comforts along in a brave attempt to make their quarters bearable. They had their own folding chairs, washstands, linen, and even chintz curtains to hang across the door.<br><br>Soldiers&#x2019; wives had the worst time of all. The Army&#x2019;s own troopships were appalling&#x2014;leaking, dirty, and cramped&#x2014;and the transports it sometimes had to hire from private contractors were scarcely better. Since the usual class distinctions were rigidly observed at sea, officers&#x2019; ladies at least got cabins; &#x201c;wives of others ranks,&#x201d; as the Army described them, were belowdecks, often in a corner of the hold next to the horses. There they endured the voyage, sleeping, eating, and passing their days in a stench which got worse as the voyage dragged on. Unless they were working for an officer&#x2019;s wife, they had little opportunity of getting on deck.<br><br>The military authorities of the eighteenth and early nineteenth c...</p><h2>The Impossible Dream Remembered: The 1967 Red Sox</h2><p>This moment-by-moment tribute to the 1967 Red Sox includes many special boxes, statistics, and personal insights from the players and excerpts from Bobby Doerr&#39;s diary</p><p>J.

Paced by the marvelous all around play of Carl Yastrzemski, the pitching of Jim Lonborg, and the fiery play of the ill-fated Tony Conigliaro, who was almost killed by a beanball, Boston's surge to the top of the league was a memorable one. Red Sox radio announcer Coleman and writer Valenti have re-created an almost tediously detailed diary of that fabulous year. The all-too-familiar finaleBoston's losing the World Serieshardly diminishes the story.

Ellis, the unexpected story of why the thirteen colonies, having just fought off the imposition of a distant centralized governing power, would decide to subordinate themselves anew.<br><br> We all know the famous opening phrase of Lincoln&#x2019;s Gettysburg Address: &#x201c;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this Continent a new Nation.&#x201d; The truth is different. In 1776, thirteen American colonies declared themselves independent states that only temporarily joined forces in order to defeat the British. Once victorious, they planned to go their separate ways. The triumph of the American Revolution was neither an ideological nor a political guarantee that the colonies would relinquish their independence and accept the creation of a federal government with power over their autonomy as states.<br><br> <i>The Quartet</i> is the story of this second American founding and of the men most responsible&#x2014;George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. These men, with the help of Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, shaped the contours of American history by diagnosing the systemic dysfunctions created by the Articles of Confederation, manipulating the political process to force the calling of the Constitutional Convention, conspiring to set the agenda in Philadelphia, orchestrating the debate in the state ratifying conventions, and, finally, drafting the Bill of Rights to assure state compliance with the constitutional settlement.<br><br> Ellis has given us a gripping and dramatic portrait of one of the most crucial and misconstrued periods in American history: the years between the end of the Revolution and the formation of the federal government. <i>The Quartet</i> unmasks a myth, and in its place presents an even more compelling truth&#x2014;one that lies at the heart of understanding the creation of the United States of America.</p><p><b>JOSEPH J. ELLIS </b>is the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>Founding Brothers. </i>His portrait of Thomas Jefferson, <i>American Sphinx,</i>&nbsp;won the National Book Award.&nbsp;He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts, with his wife, Ellen, his youngest son, three dogs, and a cat.<b><i>Preface: </i>Pluribus <i>to </i>Unum</b><br>&nbsp;<br>The idea for this book first came to me while listening to twenty-eight middle school boys recite the Gettysburg Address from memory in front of their classmates and proud parents. My son Scott was teaching science at the Greenwood School in Putney, Vermont, and had invited me to judge the annual oratorical contest. I don&#x2019;t remember exactly when it happened, but at some point during the strenuous if repetitious effort to get Lincoln&#x2019;s words right, it dawned on me that the first clause in the first sentence of Lincoln&#x2019;s famous speech was historically incorrect.<br><br>Lincoln began as follows: &#x201c;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this Continent a new Nation.&#x201d; No, not really. In 1776 thirteen American colonies declared themselves independent states that came together temporarily to win the war, then would go their separate ways. The government they created in 1781, called the Articles of Confederation, was not really much of a government at all and was never intended to be. It was, instead, what one historian has called a &#x201c;Peace Pact&#x201d; among sovereign states that regarded themselves as mini-nations of their own, that came together voluntarily for mutual security in a domestic version of a League of Nations.<br><br>And once you started thinking along these lines, there were reasons as self-evident as Jefferson&#x2019;s famous truths why no such thing as a coherent American nation could possibly have emerged after independence was won. Politically, a state-based framework followed naturally from the arguments that the colonies had been hurling at the British ministry for over a decade, which denied Parliament&#x2019;s right to tax them because that authority resided within the respective colonial legislatures, which represented their constituents in a more direct and proximate fashion than those distant members of Parliament could ever do. The resolution declaring independence, approved on July 2, 1776, clearly states that the former colonies were leaving the British Empire not as a single collective but rather as &#x201c;Free and Independent States.&#x201d;<br><br>Distance also made a huge difference. The vast majority of Americans were born, lived out their lives, and died within a thirty-mile geographic radius. It took three weeks for a letter to get from Bos�ton to Philadelphia. Political horizons and allegiances, therefore, were limited&#x2014;obviously no such things as radios, cell phones, or the Internet existed to solve the distance problem&#x2014;so the ideal politi�cal unit was the town or county government, where representatives could be trusted to defend your interests because they shared them as your neighbors.<br><br>Indeed, it was presumed that any faraway national government would represent a domestic version of Parliament, too removed from the interests and experiences of the American citizenry to be trusted. And distrusting such distant sources of political power had become a core ideological impulse of the movement for independence, often assuming quasi-paranoid hostility toward any projection of power from London and Whitehall, which was described as inherently arbitrary, imperious, and corrupt. And so creating a national government was the last thing on the minds of American revolutionaries, since such a distant source of political power embodied all the tyran�nical tendencies that patriotic Americans believed they were rebelling against.<br><br>In 1863 Lincoln had some compelling reasons for bending the arc of American history in a national direction, since he was then waging a civil war on behalf of a union that he claimed predated the existence of the states. This was a fundamental distortion of how history happened, though we may wish to forgive Lincoln, since it was the only way for him to claim the political authority to end slavery. <br><br>Truth be known, nationhood was never a goal of the war for independence, and all the political institutions necessary for a viable American nation-state were thoroughly stigmatized in the most heartfelt convictions of revolutionary ideology. The only thing holding the American colonies together until 1776 was their membership in the British Empire. The only thing holding them together after 1776 was their common resolve to leave that empire. Once the war was won, that cord was cut, and the states began to float into their own at best regional orbits. Any historically informed prophet who was straddling that postwar moment could have safely predicted that North America was destined to become a western version of Europe, a constellation of rival political camps and countries, all jockeying for primacy. That, at least, was the clear direction in which American history was headed.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>To say that &#x201c;something happened&#x201d; to change that direction is obviously inadequate. The beauty of the Lincoln version of the story is its presumption that a national ethos was already embedded in the political equation, albeit latently or implicitly, so that what we might call the second revolution of 1787&#x2013;88 followed naturally from the first in 1776. But for all the political, ideological, and demographic reasons already noted, the transition from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution cannot be described as natural. Quite the contrary, it represented a dramatic change in direction and in scale, in effect from a confederation of sovereign states to a nation-size republic, indeed the largest republic ever established.<br><br>So how do we explain such a seismic shift in the gravitational field of American political history? Well, the kind of bottom-up explanation that works so well to convey popular opposition to British impe�rial policy in the 1760s and 1770s will not work in the 1780s. Mobs did not appear, urging the creation of a fully empowered American nation. Quite the opposite: the dominant historical forces in the 1780s were centrifugal rather than centripetal, meaning that the vast majority of citizens had no interest in American nationhood; indeed, they regarded the very idea of a national government as irrelevant to their local lives and ominously reminiscent of the British leviathan they had recently vanquished. There was no popular insurgency for a national government because such a thing was not popular.<br><br>The obvious alternative explanation is top-down. All democratic cultures find such explanations offensive because they violate the hallowed conviction that, at least in the long run, popular majorities can best decide the direction that history should take. However true that conviction might be over the full span of American history&#x2014;and the claim is contestable&#x2014;it does not work for the 1780s, which just might be the most conspicuous and consequential example of the way in which a small group of prominent leaders, in disregard of popular opinion, carried the American story in a new direction.<br><br>There is an ironic precedent for this argument. During the first half of the twentieth century Charles Beard and his disciples, chiefly Merrill Jensen, created a school of thought, called the Progressive School, that dominated our understanding of the revolutionary era. While much of their work has not aged well, chiefly its claim that the founders were driven primarily by economic motives, two features of their story line remain abidingly relevant: first, that the founders must not be regarded as demigods with unique access to supernatural wisdom; and second, that the transition from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution was orchestrated by a political elite that collaborated&#x2014;to say &#x201c;conspired&#x201d; seems sinister, but it is what the Progressives meant&#x2014;to replace a state-based confederation with a federal government that claimed to speak for the American people as a collective whole.<br><br>In virtually every other respect, the narrative offered in the pages that follow veers in a different direction from the Progressive interpretation. My sense is that the most prominent leaders of this founding elite were driven by motives that were more political than economic, chiefly the desire to expand the meaning of the American Revolution so that it could function on a larger, indeed national, scale. The great conflict, as I see it, was not between &#x201c;aristocracy&#x201d; and &#x201c;democracy,&#x201d; whatever those elusive categories might mean, but rather between &#x201c;nationalists&#x201d; and &#x201c;confederationists,&#x201d; which is shorthand for those who believed that the principles of the American Revolution could flourish in a much larger political theater and those who did not. Finally, my version of the story regards the successful collaboration of this small cadre not as a betrayal of the core convictions of the American Revolution, but rather as a quite brilliant rescue.<br><br>My argument is that four men made the transition from confederation to nation happen. They are George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. If they are the stars of the story, the supporting cast consists of Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris (no relation), and Thomas Jefferson. Readers can and should decide for themselves, but my contention is that this political quartet diagnosed the systemic dysfunctions under the Articles, manipulated the political process to force a calling of the Constitutional Convention, collaborated to set the agenda in Philadelphia, attempted somewhat successfully to orchestrate the debates in the state ratifying conventions, then drafted the Bill of Rights as an insurance policy to ensure state compliance with the constitutional settlement. If I am right, this was arguably the most creative and consequential act of political leadership in American history.<br><br>It made a huge difference that all four of the political collaborators identified here possessed impeccable revolutionary credentials. (The posture of Progressive historians has always seemed somewhat odd on this score, since the men they accused of hijacking the American Revolution were all central players in making the victory over Great Britain happen.) If the overarching issue at stake was what direction the American Revolution should take after independence was won, no one could accuse them of failing to grasp the almost mystical meaning of &#x201c;The Cause.&#x201d; And since Washington was the one-man embodiment of all the semi-sacred reverberations that term conveyed, his endorsement of the national agenda provided a crucial veneer of legitimacy for their bold and slightly illegal project. It also helped that all four of them had served in the Continental Army or the Continental (then Confederation) Congress, which meant that they had experienced the war for independence from a higher perch than most of their contemporaries. They were accustomed, as Hamilton put it, to &#x201c;think continentally&#x201d; at a time when the allegiances and perspectives of most Americans were confined within local and state borders. Indeed, the very term <i>American Revolution </i>implies a national ethos that in fact did not exist in the population at large.<br><br>Perhaps the best way to understand the term <i>American Revolution </i>is to realize that it describes a two-tiered political process. The first American Revolution achieved independence. It was a mere, or perhaps not so mere, colonial rebellion. It also created a series of mini-republics in the former colonies, now states, but it did so in ways that were inherently incompatible with any national political agenda.<br><br>The second American Revolution modified the republican framework existent in the states in order to create a nation-size republic. The overly succinct way to put it is that the American Revolu�tion did not become a full-fledged revolution until it became more expansively American. Or even more succinctly, the first phase of the American Revolution was about the rejection of political power; the second phase was about controlling it. More practically, the United States could not become the dominant model for the liberal state in the modern world until the second American Revolution of 1787&#x2013;88.</p><h2>Specters of Revolt</h2><p>In 1848, Karl Marx declared that a communist specter was haunting Europe. In 1994, Jacques Derrida considered how the spectre of Marx would haunt the post-Cold War world. In <i>Specters of Revolt</i>, Gilman-Opalsky argues that the world is haunted by revolt, by the possibility of events that interrupt and disrupt the world, that throw its reality and justice into question. But recent revolt is neither decisively communist nor decisively Marxist. Gilman-Opalsky develops a theory of revolt that accounts for its diverse critical content about autonomy, everyday life, anxiety, experience, knowledge, and possibility. The 1994 uprising of the Mexican Zapatistas set the stage for new forms of revolt against a newly expanded power of capital. In the 20 years since, including the recent phase of global uprisings that began in 2008 with the Greek revolts, insurrection has spoken in the "Arab&nbsp;Spring"&nbsp;in Spain, Turkey, Brazil, and in the U.S. in Occupy Wall Street, Ferguson, and Baltimore, among other places. In light of recent global uprisings, Gilman-Opalsky aims to move beyond the critical theory of revolt to an understanding of revolt as theory itself. Making use of diverse sources from Raoul Vaneigem and F�lix Guattari to Julia Kristeva and Raya Dunayevskaya, Spectres of Revolt explores upheaval as thinking, the intellect of insurrection, and philosophy from below.</p><p>Richard Gilman-Opalsky, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Political Philosophy in the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Springfield. He received his Ph.D. from The New School for Social Research in New York City.

Incredulous, Roberts -- an expert on exploration literature who had never heard of this account -- was determined to learn the truth behind this extraordinary story. Little did he know that his search would ultimately bring him closer to the experiences of these four survivors than he had imagined. <br> In 1743 four survivors of a Russian shipwreck in the Arctic Ocean were trapped on a tiny island with only twenty pounds of flour for food. With ingenuity and courage they endured six years of nearly unimaginable hardship, with only driftwood to fuel their life-saving fires, and the constant threat of attack from polar bears (they would kill ten with homemade lances). Roberts's quest to document their story would take him across two continents and culminate in his own expedition to the remote and desolate shores where these mysterious sailors had been marooned. Riveting and haunting, <i>Four Against the Arctic</i> chronicles an incredible true story.</p><p><b>David Roberts </b>is the author of twenty-four books on mountaineering, adventure, and the history of the American Southwest. His essays and articles have appeared in <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>National Geographic Adventure</i>, and <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, among other publications. He lives in Watertown, Massachusetts.The tale at the heart of this recording is one of the greatest feats of wilderness survival in history, though it's virtually unknown. In 1743, four Russian walrus hunters were stranded on Svalbard with two days' supplies and stayed alive for more than six years. Beginning with one unreliable source document, Roberts doggedly pursues every thread of the story in libraries, Russian archives, and on Svalbard itself, during a two-week visit. In the process, he becomes the story, padding it with self-absorbed detail but also with fascinating digressions. He's helped along by Robertson Dean's reading, which is well paced and keeps the narrative moving, even when it threatens to get stuck in the ice.

The history of Sing Sing dates back to 1825, when warden Elam Lynds brought one hundred inmates to begin construction of the prison &#34;up the river&#34; on the banks of the Hudson. The marble quarry that supplied the building material for the prison was located in an area that was once home to the Sint Sink, a Native American tribe whose name means &#34;stone upon stone.&#34; Prison life was dominated by hard labor during the early years. Convicts in striped suits and shackles built the prison with their own hands. With the arrival of warden Lewis Lawes in 1920, Sing Sing became the most progressive prison of its kind. During this time, the New York Yankees traveled up to Sing Sing to play the prison&#39;s home baseball team; the prison grounds were landscaped with shrubbery and flower gardens; and the compound grew to include a chapel, mess hall, barbershop, library, and gymnasium. The electric chair was first introduced at Sing Sing in 1891. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the first civilians to be found guilty of espionage, were put to death there in 1953.

UNTOUCHABLE, the one gangster the Feds can't touch? And how is the future Mayor of New York City Rudolf Giuliani involved? With Machiavellian pragmatism matched with biblical fury, Barnes lays bare his life's remarkable trajectory--a rise, fall and resurrection defined by brutality, brotherhood and betrayal.</p></p><p>LEROY "NICKY" BARNES is the most famous black syndicated drug lord in history. Convicted of narcotics conspiracy in 1977 by the nation's first anonymous jury. Released in 1998 with a recommendation for parole from U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani in his file, Barnes's landmark cooperation with the U.S. Government served to indict over fifty major drug traffickers.

His work has appeared on A&amp;E, MSNBC and Showtime. He lives in New York City.</p>This memoir by a former New York heroin kingpin&#x2014;reportedly the inspiration for the song "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" and the movie <i>New Jack City</i>, among others&#x2014;pulsates with the criminal street life it depicts so well. In the 1970s, Barnes, a former junkie, built a heroin operation that delivered tens of millions of dollars worth of dope annually to the New York area. He became a street hero for his flamboyant lifestyle. Using a heavy dose of street slang to add flavor, Barnes portrays a dangerous but exciting life, the allure of the money and power he and his associates accrued, even as the drug trade sowed the seeds of their destruction. With documentary filmmaker Folsom's help, Barnes shows how he built his empire, creating a ruthlessly efficient drug organization modeled after the Mafia and known as "The Council." Barnes's ability to elude prison earned him the nickname Mr. Untouchable, but eventually prosecutors caught up to him, and in 1977 he was sentenced to life in prison. Eventually, Barnes turned state's evidence, earned his release in 1998 and joined the federal Witness Protection Program. But even now, Barnes's lack of regret gives this captivating work an added air of authenticity. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A Chinese hand laundry is an unlikely setting for great food, but for eighteen years Yee thrived on dishes that boasted the authentic flavor and variety of the best Cantonese cooking. As an adult, she's tasted fine cuisine in many places, but for food that pleases the palate and warms the heart, she always prefers the home-cooked meals of her childhood, which are lovingly collected in this volume.<p>This style of cooking -- the chief characteristic of her parents' native province of Guangdong -- demands fresh ingredients, so Yee's parents followed the tradition of adapting the produce of their new home to the flavors of the old. Like all Cantonese cooks, her mother took pride in her creative variations and put her unique stamp on everything she cooked. Day in and day out, she created meals that were tasty, nutritious, and never boring. Yee also recalls the "comfort" food that her mother cooked for her when she came down with a cold: a hot bowl of rice juk (congee, or gruel) topped by a poached egg, green onions, and a bit of oyster sauce for seasoning. It went down a sore throat very smoothly. Chewing a piece of ginger effectively "cleared the system".</p><p>Yee's family believed that food and health were vitally linked. If the balance of elements -- "heating" and "cooling" foods -- was not matched to the season, then illness was more likely. It was a low-fat, high vegetable diet that contributed to the family's well-being -- and will appeal to today's health-conscious cook.</p><p>This title is the second of many to come in the First Glance Immigrant Cookbook series.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Magic Power of Self-Image Psychology</h2><p>This book will show you a new way to a bright &amp; full life.

The Man-in-the-Moon, it seems, once fell in love with "a woman who lived in a little blue house, deep in a forest glade." Like Barbara Berger's Grandfather Twilight (Philomel), this is an original myth that reverberates with the magical appeal of an ancient story. The debut of both author and illustrator is no run-of-the-mill picture book: though younger children may require an adult interpretation, the fantasy elements here are sure to prove engrossing. Brumbeau's text, seemingly straightforward, has an old-fashioned storybook charm. Couch's wistful, stylized art evinces a '30s romantic air--one can almost hear strains of big band music in the background. The illustrations are rich in midnight blue and pearly white and burn with an intense orange glow when the Man-in-the-Sun appears. This multifaceted tale will catch many children's fancies--and gladden the hearts of adults with an amatory bent as well. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 2-- Readers who have wondered where the Man-in-the-Moon goes for part of each lunar cycle will learn that he's with his wife on Earth, of course. Brumbeau's story tells how this came to be: the Man-in-the-Moon's wife made a deal with the Man-in-the-Sun, who rules such matters, that for part of each month her husband would stay on the moon and keep it lit, and for the rest of the month he would visit her. Couch's dark-hued forms and angled lines give the illustrations a modern, sophisticated look. The drawings are reminiscent of Picasso's blue period in the use of many shades of that color. These hues work well with the text, giving readers a humorous explanation of what might happen on moonless nights. --Rachel Fox, Port Washington Pub .

Greene Series)</h2><p>The story of the five Marlow brothers and their tribulations in late nineteenth-century Texas is the stuff of Old West legend (and served to inspire the John Wayne movie, <i>The Sons of Katie Elder</i>). Violent, full of intrigue, with characters of amazing heroism and deplorable cowardice, their story was first related by William Rathmell in <i>Life of the </i><i>Marlows</i>, a little book published in 1892, shortly after the events it described in Young County, Texas.<br><br>It told how Boone, the most reckless of the brothers, shot and killed a popular sheriff and escaped, only to be murdered later by bounty hunters. The other four brothers, arrested as accessories and jailed, made a daring break from confinement but were recaptured. Once back in their cells, they were forced to fight off a mob intent on lynching them. Later, shackled together, the Marlows were placed on wagons by officers late at night, bound for another town, but they were ambushed by angry citizens. In the resulting battle two of the brothers were shot and killed, the other two severely wounded, and three mob members died. The surviving brothers eventually were exonerated, but members of the mob that had attacked them were prosecuted in cases that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>The original 1892 edition and expanded reprint of 1931 are both quite scarce. Later writers drew upon Rathmell&#x2019;s account when telling the story of the Marlows, but all accounts were slanted sympathetically toward them, given the same bias by Rathmell. Now Robert K. DeArment, a noted historian of outlaws and lawmen of the West, has sifted through the evidence and presents herein an objective, annotated edition of <i>Life of the </i><i>Marlows</i>, which contains extensive clarifying and corrective footnotes and an index. Now the complete story can be told and readers can judge for themselves: were the Marlows as law-abiding as Rathmell claims? Or was the mob reacting with justified anger?</p><p>Robert K. DeArment is a longtime member of the Western Writers of America and the Wild West History Association (formerly NOLA and WOLA). He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Bat Masterson, George Scarborough,</i> and <i>Alias Frank Canton</i>. He lives in Sylvania, Ohio.&#34;This is raw late 1800s history at its finest and most tragic, a story of hate, death, love, injustice, brutality, vengeance, and triumph. And it is all brought together and written by a master historian and storyteller, Robert K. DeArment.&#34; - Leon Metz, author of Pat Garrett and John Wesley Hardin &#34;This book will be a significant addition to the literature of frontier violence.&#34; - Bill O&#39;Neal, author of Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters&#34;</p><h2>Killshot</h2><p><p>Armand Degas is a Mafia hit man the guys call Blackbird.

Not only is this a beautiful keepsake edition, full of gorgeous illustrations by Antonio Javier Caparo, but the prose retellings by beloved classic children&#x2019;s book author E. Nesbit are an excellent tool to introduce children to the complex language of Shakespeare.</p><p>A foreword by John Lithgow touches on his own childhood as a Shakespearean actor and the importance of Shakespeare. The book contains extensive support materials, including a biography, a timeline of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life, and further recommended readings.</p><p>In this volume, you will find:</p><ul><li><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></li><li><em>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</em></li><li><em>Twelfth Night</em></li><li><em>Hamlet</em></li><li><em>Macbeth</em></li><li><em>The Tempest</em></li><li><em>Much Ado About Nothing</em></li></ul></p><p><p>Edith Nesbit Bland (1858-1924) published most of her work under the signature of E.

Her works include <em>The Railway Children, The Story of the Treasure Seekers,</em> and <em>The Wouldbegoods</em>.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;6&#x2014;In an attractive arrangement, this volume presents four comedies and three tragedies by William Shakespeare in short story format. The text, by the late British author Nesbit, retells the basic plots of the plays in a gentle, fairy-tale style. Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and Hamlet are still full of conflict and death, but the details are softened for the audience. At the beginning of each piece, the cast of characters and the scene are identified, along with a famous quote. The artwork, created with Adobe Photoshop, helps children picture the settings. To provide further context, the text includes a biographical sketch of Shakespeare, a time line of his life and works, and recommended resources that list modern and adapted versions of the plays as well as DVDs and websites. Bruce Coville's picture book retellings of Shakespeare's works have longer texts and more numerous illustrations than this title. VERDICT Libraries that already own Tina Packer's Tales from Shakespeare would find this new volume somewhat redundant. Otherwise, this selection offers an inviting gateway into these classics.&#x2014;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</p><h2>Soviet Partisans in World War II</h2><p>Soviet Partisans in World War II is a summation and an extension - both carried out with great talent by Professor John A. Armstrong of the University of Wisconsin - of a postwar program of research into the origins, doctrine, operations, and effectiveness of Soviet irregular warfare. The volume can be read as an original and important contribution to the history of World War II and to the study of the Soviet political system operating under extreme stress. Originally published in 1964, when Soviet policy layed strong emphasis on &#34;wars of national (or people&#39;s) liberation&#34; and on Soviet backing for them, these studies likewise provided a fresh examination of the then recent and intensive Soviet experience in the waging of unconventional warfare.</p><p></p><h2>Holding the Man</h2><p>Based on the much loved book by Timothy Conigrave, adapted for the stage by one of Australia&#x2019;s leading young playwrights.</p><p>TOMMY MURPHY is a graduate of the University of Sydney and the National Institute of Dramatic Art.

A young, beautiful prostitute thinks better of her latest client, a baseball player who has already killed 11 spectators with his foul shots, than she does of married men "playing the dark game that some men did, putting themselves closer and closer to the edge of their lives, until something went over." A warrior justifies a major tactical mistake (not leaving enough time for the cauldron of oil to heat) in a gung-ho bureaucratic report: "The problems of the day were not attributable to inappropriate deportment. My staff was good. It was when the Visigoths had approached close enough that we could see their cruel eyes and we could read the savage and misspelled tattoos that I realized our error." <p> <i>Hotel Eden</i> offers two hilarious stories, the boiling oil project and a complex variation on a suburban myth. A young couple necking in an isolated spot hears scratching on one side of the car, speeds off, and discovers the local psychopath's prosthetic hook on the door handle. In Ron Carlson's telling, the item belongs to an innocent mental-asylum watchman. And Mr. Howard Lugdrum is more than a little upset that everyone's sympathy is going to the kids! "I was lucky I was wearing my simple hook and the straps broke; if I'd been wearing my regular armature, those two little criminals would have dragged me to death." This is a seriously funny collection, but it is also serious. In several pieces, notably the title story, "Oxygen," and "Nightcap," the characters are led astray and into disappointment or unwanted knowledge. The college student delivering medical oxygen one summer vacation realizes, "I was young those nights, but I was getting over it." Carlson is also a poet of precarious lives, humiliation, and loss.</p>Ron Carlson teaches Creative Writing at Arizona State University.

While there, the Darcys&nbsp;get involved with marriage arrangements, star-crossed lovers, deceit, mistaken identity, and even murder.</p><p>Once again the Darcys take center stage as the Regency era's answer to <i>The Thin Man</i>'s Nick and Nora in this delightful series by the 2007 Daphne du Maurier Award-winning author of <i><i>North by Northanger.</i></i></p></p><p><p>Carrie Bebris is a freelance writer and editor.&nbsp; She holds a master's degree in English literature and is a life member of the Jane Austen Society of North America.&nbsp; A Wisconsin native, she now resides in Ohio. <i>The Matters at Mansfield </i>&nbsp;is her fourth Mr. &amp; Mrs. Darcy mystery.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>She was all surprise and embarrassment. </p><p><i>&#x2014;Mansfield Park</i></p><p>It is a truth less frequently acknowledged, that a good mother in possession of a single child, must be in want of sleep.</p><p>Whatever the habits or inclinations of such a woman might have been prior to her first entering the maternal state, in very short order her feelings and thoughts are so well fixed on her progeny that at any given hour she is considered, at least in the young minds of the principals, as the rightful property of some one or other of her offspring.</p><p>Be she a woman of comfortable income, assistants may alleviate many of the demands imposed on her, and indeed there are ladies quite content to consign their little darlings entirely to the care of nurses and governesses until they reach a more independent age. But in most families, occasions arise when even the most competent, affectionate servant cannot replace a child&#x2019;s need for Mama, and when said Mama wants no proxy.</p><p>And so it was that Elizabeth Darcy, wife of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, mistress of the great estate of Pemberley, and presently the houseguest of the Earl of Southwell, found herself the only conscious person in all of Riveton Hall during the predawn hours of an early August morning. Or rather, the only conscious adult, her daughter being so awake to the pain of cutting her first tooth that none but her mother&#x2019;s arms could comfort her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hush now, Lily-Anne. Mama&#x2019;s here.&#x201d; Elizabeth offered the crooked knuckle of her forefinger to the child to gum. Having come to the nursery to check on Lily before retiring, she had found both baby and nurse so overwrought by hours of ceaseless crying (on the child&#x2019;s part, not the nurse&#x2019;s) that she had dismissed Mrs. Flaherty to capture a few hours&#x2019; rest. The stubborn tooth had troubled Lily since their arrival and rendered futile every traditional remedy the veteran nurse had tried. If it did not break through this eve, the morrow would prove an even longer day for Mrs. Flaherty and her charge. Elizabeth herself would be unavailable to soothe her daughter, her time instead commanded by the event that had occasioned her and Darcy&#x2019;s visit to Riveton.</p><p>Darcy&#x2019;s cousin Roger Fitzwilliam, the earl, was hosting a ball to introduce his new fianc�e to his family and neighbors. The Pemberley party&#x2014;Elizabeth, Darcy, Lily-Anne, and Darcy&#x2019;s sister, Georgiana&#x2014;had traveled to the groom&#x2019;s Buckinghamshire estate earlier in the week, as had the bride&#x2019;s family and numerous other guests. Darcy and Roger&#x2019;s aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, had been the first to arrive, appearing a full fortnight earlier than anticipated to oversee her nephew&#x2019;s preparations. As the late earl&#x2019;s sister, her ladyship had grown up at Riveton Hall, and continued to generously dispense opinions regarding its management. That the present earl had little interest in hearing her advice did little to check its flow.</p><p>Having herself recently endured an extended visit by Lady Catherine, Elizabeth sympathized with her besieged host.</p><p>The earl, however, enjoyed one advantage that Elizabeth, in Derbyshire, had not: Lady Catherine yet maintained a large acquaintance in her former neighborhood, and had absented herself from Riveton for part of each day to call upon them. Her daughter, Miss Anne de Bourgh, joined her on most of these excursions.</p><p>How Southwell&#x2019;s neighbors bore Lady Catherine&#x2019;s company eluded Elizabeth and Darcy, but they were grateful to be subjected to so little of it themselves. Their already inharmonious relationship with Darcy&#x2019;s aunt had been further fractured by the events of her prolonged residence at Pemberley, and the present house party at Riveton marked their first meeting since.</p><p>Her daily absences had enabled them all to settle into a tacit, if tense, truce.</p><p>In contrast, Elizabeth had taken great pleasure in renewing her acquaintance with Roger&#x2019;s younger brother, Colonel James Fitzwilliam, whom she had met two years previous. The colonel&#x2019;s forthright manners and intelligent conversation united to make him the most amiable of Darcy&#x2019;s maternal relations, and she regretted that his military duties prevented more frequent opportunities to enjoy his society.</p><p>The only society Elizabeth coveted at the moment, however, were the inhabitants of her dreams. She paced the nursery, murmuring the sort of sibilant nonsense mothers have employed for millennia to calm distressed infants. Despite the stimulus of Lily&#x2019;s wails, her own eyelids burned with the urge to close. Yet even if she roused Mrs. Flaherty and returned to her own quiet chamber, she knew that maternal anxiety, or at a minimum, maternal guilt, would not allow her to sleep while her daughter suffered.</p><p>She sang. She rocked. She paced still more.</p><p>At last, exhaustion claimed Lily-Anne, and blessed silence settled upon the nursery. It was, however, a fitful slumber. Lily was still in discomfort, unconsciously rubbing her jaw against her mother&#x2019;s shoulder and squirming each time Elizabeth tried to lower her into the crib. Elizabeth sat with her awhile in a chair, but was so tired that she did not trust herself to retain a safe hold on Lily should she, too, succumb to sleep.</p><p>She decided to bring Lily back to her own chamber, in hopes that a shared bed would enable them both to rest. Darcy would not mind. There had been a few occasions at Pemberley when Lily, in need of extra comfort, had slept in their bed, and Darcy&#x2019;s presence often had a calming effect on the baby, awake or asleep.</p><p>She moved quietly as she carried Lily down the corridor where the earl&#x2019;s relations were quartered. The bride and her family occupied the floor above, and several gentleman friends of Roger&#x2019;s were in another wing altogether. She did not fear disturbing these more distant guests should Lily suddenly waken and complain at full volume, but Lady Catherine&#x2019;s room she passed with extra caution. Her ladyship&#x2019;s tenure at Pemberley had proven her a light sleeper, ever alert to everyone else&#x2019;s affairs.</p><p>She rounded a corner and stopped suddenly. </p><p>Anne de Bourgh appeared equally startled. They had very nearly collided. &#x201c;Mrs. Darcy!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss de Bourgh?&#x201d;</p><p>Both spoke in the lowest of whispers. Anne cast an alarmed glance in the direction of her mother&#x2019;s chamber. In the weak grey light just beginning to penetrate a nearby window, her face appeared pale as usual, but her features had lost some of their sharpness. The angles of her cheekbones had rounded, dissolving her typically haughty expression and softening her countenance.</p><p>Instead of pinched, she looked almost pretty.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2014;I did not expect to&#x2014;that is . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nor I.&#x201d; Elizabeth shifted Lily to her other shoulder. The child had entered a deeper sleep as they walked and was becoming heavier by the minute. &#x201c;I thought none but Lily and I was awake, and even she has finally decided the hour is grown quite late enough.&#x201d; She tried to formulate a polite query as to why Miss de Bourgh was wandering Riveton Hall fully dressed at half past four in the morning. She doubted that Anne, coddled since childhood for fragile health, routinely kept late hours. But her fatigued mind was not equal to the challenge of clever phrasing. &#x201c;What draws you from your bed at this time of night?&#x201d; she finally blurted.</p><p>&#x201c;No one. I mean&#x2014;&#x201d;Anne nodded at Lily. &#x201c;The child did not wake me, if that is your concern.&#x201d;</p><p>It had not been. In fact, the thought had not so much as entered Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind, which was primarily occupied with calculating how many hours&#x2019; sleep she might yet manage to capture if she nodded off immediately upon reaching her pillow. Another part of her brain was attempting to determine whether Anne&#x2019;s improved appearance were indeed a trick of the light or a genuine transformation. Upon continued observation, the view afforded by their unusually close proximity suggested the latter.</p><p>Anne bristled under Elizabeth&#x2019;s scrutiny. Her gaze strayed to the window. &#x201c;Actually, I am not up late, but very early. I woke and could not return to sleep, so I thought I would stroll in the rose garden whilst the sun rose.&#x201d;</p><p>Unlike herself, Elizabeth had never known Miss de Bourgh to take pleasure in walking or, for that matter, to walk any farther than necessity demanded.

Perfect company in bed * Salley Vickers * Inspector Morse would appear to have a rival * Scotland on Sunday * A charmingly effective tale of detection ... evoking oodles of churchy village atmosphere, circa 1953, provides a satisfyingly old-fashioned read * The Times * The clerical milieu is well rendered as an affectionate eye is cast over post-war England - a perfect accompaniment to a sunny afternoon, a hammock and a glass of Pimm&#39;s -- Laura Wilson * Guardian * James Runcie has written the coziest of cozy murder mysteries. Taken individually, each of these clerical whodunits poses a clever puzzle for armchair detectives. Viewed as a collective study of British life as it was lived when Elizabeth II first ascended the throne, these stories present a consistently charming and occasionally cutting commentary on &#39;a postwar landscape full of industry, promise and concrete * New York Times Book Review * An undiluted pleasure * Scotsman * Full of witty phrases to delight the reader ... This entertaining first volume about Canon Chambers will have Runcie&#39;s readers longing for the next * Peggy Woodford, Church Times * An evocation of a more genteel era ... Chambers turns out to be a winning clergyman-sleuth, and Runcie&#39;s literary authority is repeatedly demonstrated in the construction of his elegant tales. In fact, it is the plotting that really distinguishes this collection, and will make many more readers more than ready to follow the God-fearing hero from the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 to the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981 ... there is no denying the winning charm of these artfully fashioned mysteries * Independent * Gentle criminal entertainment with a pleasantly old-fashioned feel to it -- Andrew Taylor * Spectator * The plots are intriguing ... While the diminutive priest detective created by G. K. Chesterton led the way, Sidney Chambers is set fair to be a worthy successor. In a sceptical age this is quite an achievement.

It addresses this both structurally (via its unique setting) and thematically (via its alienated, tribeless hero-protagonist).

Howard's Conan the Barbarian. Set in the sub-Saharan equivalent of Howard's imaginary Hyborea, this origin story, the first in a projected five-volume series, tells how Imaro (who seems to run afoul of sorcerers as readily as Howard's barbarian did) is falsely accused at the conclusion of his manhood rite, exiled from his tribe and transformed into an embittered, homicidal wanderer in a landscape of savage beasts and savage men, yet retains, as such heroes usually do, a certain chivalrous decency. The unusual setting more than makes up for the routine plot. Saunders alone has appreciated the potential of Africa as a backdrop for heroic fantasy. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

John Maynard Keynes is the man who saved Britain from financial crisis not once but twice - over the course of two World Wars. He remains a highly influential figure, nearly 70 years after his death. But who was he? In this entertaining biography, Richard Davenport-Hines gives us the man behind the economics: the connoisseur, intellectual, public official and statesman who was equally at ease socialising with the Bloomsbury Group as he was persuading prime ministers and presidents. By exploring the desires and experiences that made Keynes think as he did, Davenport-Hines reveals the aesthetic basis of Keynesian economics, and explores why the ideas of this Great Briton continue to resonate so powerfully today.</p><p>Richard Davenport-Hines won the Wolfson Prize for History for his first book, &#39;Dudley Docker&#39;. He is an adviser to the &#39;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&#39; and has also written biographies of W.H. Auden and Marcel Proust. His most recent book, &#39;An English Affair&#39; was published in 2013. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Literature, he reviews for the &#39;Guardian&#39;, &#39;Spectator&#39; and &#39;Literary Review&#39;.&#39;Succinct, lively and well-written biography ... Done with great panache, in a volume that will introduce Keynes and his strange world to a new generation of readers&#39; Evening Standard &#39;An amusing, elegant and provocative writer ... great fun.

But he was so much more and this unputdownable book explores the man&#39; Independent &#39;Treating Keynes&#39;s lives as interesting and valuable for their own sake gives them extra vividness ... With a keen eye for telling detail and social connections, Davenport-Hines brilliantly conveys what one might call the peripheral atmospherics of Keynes&#39;s existence ...

Brooding images and dramatic 3-D scenes rise from the pages as the evil Count Dracula works his sinister spells on a new generation. Reluctant readers, horror fans, and pop-up collectors will marvel as Dracula, the world&#x2019;s most popular and feared vampire, literally jumps off the page in search of victims. With multiple interactive elements on every page, readers will undoubtedly shriek as they watch a cemetery&#x2019;s mist inch toward them, and, just when they&#x2019;ve caught their breath, try to keep in the sunlight as a stake is finally plunged into the heart of the villain. A superb example of paper engineering, this classic pop-up tale offers an interactive, blood-curdling experience while remaining true to the author&#x2019;s original version.</p><p>Bram Stoker (1847&#x2013;1912) was an Irish writer best known for his 1897 masterpiece Dracula.

Mr. Degen studied art at the Cooper Union and Pratt Institute. He was born in Brooklyn, New York&#x2014;just like Charlie Muttnik&#x2014;and now lives with his family in Connecticut.</p>PreS?Sweetly cheerful illustrations and sing-song rhymes can combine to create an unappealingly saccharine picture book, but in Degen's accomplished hands, these ingredients are melded into a delightful story of the twin joys of independence and security. A young pig enjoys imaginary adventures while never straying too far from home. Each fantastic escapade, whether it's a storm at sea, a battle with pirates, an airplane flight, or a buzzing dance near a frog-filled pond, springs from the little pig's creative play with everyday toys. The real-life outcomes of his exploits are often humorous, as when his toy plane lands unexpectedly on his father's head or a captured frog startles his mother. These and other amusing details in the colorful paintings (a clever combination of double-page spreads and inset vignettes) extend the story and ensure that repeat readings will be rewarded with fresh discoveries. The short, bouncy text mirrors the illustrations' dual focus, for each verse begins with outward motion (sailaway, flyaway, skipaway) and ends with the comforting return home. While the pastoral charm of this young animal's lakeside home (and low-tech pursuits) may be foreign to some readers, his energetic enthusiasm and clear attachment to his loving family will nonetheless endear him to a wide audience.

S. Open, found his playing career ended by carpal tunnel syndrome, which led to an exciting new career in broadcasting, forever changing his life.</p><p>"I have long admired Ken Venturi, who represents everything that is pure and proper about this wonderful game. Watching him lead the U.S. to victory in the 2000 Presidents Cup was a tremendous thrill." -George Bush, 41st president of the United States <p>"His record as a player was exceedingly rewarding, yet far too short. Injuries ended that segment of his life. But what a blessing for all of us....the perfect spokesman for his sport--the welcome guest who came into our homes 20 weeks a year, shared his stories, and bared his soul." -from the Foreward by Jim Nantz</p>Ken Venturi was already a highly regarded amateur when he burst onto golf's center stage at the 1956 Masters. The confident 24-year old from San Francisco led the field after the first, second, and third rounds, bidding to become the first amateur to win the prestigious event. He carried a four-stroke lead into Sunday's final round, only to watch in disbelief as the tournament slipped out of his grasp. In a matter of hours, with a disastrous 80, he went from within inches of the sport's pinacle to the depths of despair-and he hadn't even turned pro yet. That he would do seven months later. And in the first of a series of remarkable career-defining comebacks, he gamely overcame the devastation of his very public defeat at Augusta to prove himself to be one of the game's brightest young stars. Venturi became a fixture on the top 10 of the money list, rebounding from, of all things, another heart-wrentching defeat at Augusta in 1958. Regarded as one of the best players in the world following the 1960 season-he came so close again to winning the green jacket-Venturi soon sustained a series of injuries related to an automobile accident. His game suffered badly as a result, and he began to tumble down the money list. By 1963 he found himself struggling to gain invitations to tournaments that had once rolled out the red carpet for him. Thus began Venturi's greatest comeback of all, as he reinvented himself and his game heading into the 1964 season. After more than three years without a win, Venturi again shook the golf world by winning the 1964 U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club outside Washington, D.C. To this day it remains one of the most inspiring performances in golf history. Venturi somehow managed to hold off the field despite literally staggering from heat prostration on the final day. That incredible Open victory highlighted the best year of Venturi's career, but again, adversity was not far behind. A debilitating case of carpel tunnel syndrome left him without full use of his hands forced him to end his playing career before it ever reached its once unlimited potential. But he rose to challege yet again, carving out a legendary 35-year broadcasting career as the voice of golf for CBS television. It was in that capacity that the viewing public grew to know and love Ken Venturi, who wore his heart on his sleeve and wasn't afraid to tell it like it was. Getting Up &amp; Down is written in the same manner, providing an honest, emotional, and sometimes searing look at Venturi's life, his roller-coaster playing career, and the game to which he has devoted a lifetime.</p><h2>Righteous Fury (Legends of Alfar, 1)</h2><p>From the author of the bestselling fantasy series <i>The Dwarves</i>--which has sold over one million copies--come the dynamic new series The Legends of the Alfar.

One of the original "Colonial Nine" schools, Columbia's distinctive history has been intertwined with the history of New York City. Located first in lower Manhattan, then in midtown, and now in Morningside Heights, Columbia's national and international stature have been inextricably identified with its urban setting.<br><br>Columbia was the first of America's "multiversities," moving beyond its original character as a college dedicated to undergraduate instruction to offer a comprehensive program in professional and graduate studies. Medicine, law, architecture, and journalism have all looked to the graduates and faculty of Columbia's schools to provide for their ongoing leadership and vitality. In 2003, a sampling of Columbia alumni include one member of the United States Supreme Court, three United States senators, three congressmen, three governors (New York, New Jersey, and California), a chief justice of the New York Court of Appeals, and a president of the New York City Board of Education. But it is perhaps as a contributor of ideas and voices to the broad discourse of American intellectual life that Columbia has most distinguished itself. From <i>The Federalist Papers,</i> written by Columbians John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, to Charles Beard's <i>An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution</i> and Jack Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i> to Edward Said's <i>Orientalism,</i> Columbia and its graduates have greatly influenced American intellectual and public life. <i>Stand, Columbia</i> also examines the experiences of immigrants, women, Jews, African Americans, and other groups as it takes critical measure of the University's efforts to become more inclusive and more reflective of the diverse city that it calls home.</p><p>Marking Columbia University&#39;s 250th anniversary, this is the definitive history of one of America&#39;s oldest and most redoubtable urban institutions in the country&#39;s largest, most culturally diverse city.

In addition, there has also been a consistent inner call to dive into the depths of our hearts, to explore human potential, and to live as examples of authenticity and truth. The Pachakuti Mesa is a personal alter used ceremonially to access spiritual forces and energies for the purposes of healing, the advancement of consciousness, and the restoration of balance on both individual and collective levels. This system of medicine work stems from the Earth-based shamanic practice of Northern Coastal and Southeastern Andean regions of Peru. Ultimately, the Pachakuti Mesa acts as the shamans&#39;s tool, an instrument of sacred technology, which is used to access and cultivate an intimate relationship with Spirit, which in its nature is mystery.

In addition to updating his efforts to bring these ancient teachings to a wider audience, Mateo also brings his own personal experience with renowned Peruvian shamans and indigenous First Nation practitioners to bear on his subject matter.

It is a clear, scholarly account of mesa practice; [it explains] its place in the larger shamanic tradition, the metaphysical geography, the archetypal powers and beings, and how to construct successful ceremonies for healing purposes. Matthew Magee has done an excellent job both of researching and writing this core study on Peruvian shamanism. Here on the magician-healer's small table of symbols hovers the entire universe of accessible powers. The book discusses these spiritually charged matters in a readable, clear, and ethical presentation of how the shaman can prepare and work with these spiritual powers."<br>-<b>Dr. Stephen Larsen</b>, author of&nbsp;The Shaman's Doorway&nbsp;and other books.<br><br>"While I have studied and written about Peruvian mesa traditions for almost 20 years, in this text Matthew Magee makes the mesa understandable, accessible, and useful.

G. McConville offers a theological interpretation of the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy in the context of the biblical canon. He gives due attention to historical issues where these bear on what can be known about the settings in which the text emerged. His dominant method is one that approaches Deuteronomy as a finished work. McConville argues that in the context of the ancient world Deuteronomy should be understood as the radical blueprint for the life of a people, at the same time both spiritual and political, and profoundly different from every other social, political and religious programe. The book incorporates the tension between an open-minded vision of a perfectly ordered society under God and practical provisions for dealing with the frailty and imperfections of real people. Hence, it is capable of informing our thinking about the organization of societies while maintaining a vision of the kingdom of God.</p><p>J. Gordon McConville is professor of Old Testament theology at the University of Gloucestershire in Cheltenham, England. He is the author of several books and studies on Old Testament topics, including <em>Law and Theology in Deuteronomy</em> (JSOT Press), <em>Time and Place in Deuteronomy</em> (with J. G. Millar, JSOT Press) and <em>Judgment and Promise: An Introduction to the Book of Jeremiah</em> (Apollos)."There has been plenty of interest in the book of Daniel on the part of commentators over the past generation or two. The one that I have found of the most all-round benefit is Ernest Lucas in the Apollos Old Testament Commentary series. Lucas succeeds in drawing out the message of the book while also paying judicious attention to complex issues of history, eschatology, and composition." (Tim Meadowcroft, Catalyst, Vol. 40, No. 3, March 2014)<br><br>"Students, scholars, and ministers will derive much profit from this commentary." (James Chukwuma Okoye, The Bible in Review)<br><br>"What every preacher and student needs is a commentary that makes positive use of the results of scholarly research while at the same time integrating them sympathetically into a contemporary Christian theological worldview. Many series have set out to achieve this, but few have succeeded. Now at last the Apollos series looks set to do so: the names of the editors and potential contributors, together with the evidence of these early volumes, all inspire confidence." (H. G. M. Williamson, FBA, Regius Professor of Hebrew, University of Oxford)<br><br>"At last! A commentary series that combines the best of biblical scholarship with a passion for the message of the text. Besides, it actually answers the questions I ask when I read the Scriptures. This series by the finest evangelical scholars is designed for students and pastors who are serious about understanding the Old Testament in its context and translating its message for the church in the twenty-first century." (Daniel Block, Professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Evangelical Old Testament study has made huge strides in the second half of the twentieth century. Tyndale House in the U.K. and IVP internationally were central to that renaissance. And now at the start of the twenty-first century the Apollos Old Testament Commentary Series will build on that foundation as it showcases some of the best contemporary Old Testament interpretation. This series rightly insists on rigorous scholarship but always in the service of the theology and message of the books of the Old Testament. Some outstanding scholars are signed up for this series, and I look forward very much to having these commentaries on my shelves as they appear."

Buckley Jr.</b> (1925-2008) was the founder of <i>National Review </i>and the host of one of television's longest-running public affairs programs, <i>Firing Line</i>. The author of more than fifteen novels, many of them <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, he won the National Book Award for <i>Stained Glass</i>, the second in the series featuring Blackford Oakes.<br><br>In the best Blackford Oakes novel yet (Tucker's Last Stand, 1991, etc.), the master of the double bind builds a plot that places the CIA chief of covert ops squarely between the Maelstrom and the Wandering Rocks. Buckley dips into Black's college days, his marriage to Sally following her widowhood, with glances into the days with Kennedy and Johnson. Now, in 1995, as covert ops honcho, he's called before the Senate to defend his affair with ``Cyclops''--and refuses, risking jail instead. While President Clinton schemes to save covert ops from the Senate, we are told that sometime during the Reagan Administration--about 1985--before Gorbachev led the USSR into dissolution, Black was contacted by his old Russian buddy and adversary, Cyclops (now 85), and given knowledge that could be entrusted to Black alone: only two people, Cyclops and Black, could know that a tiny knot of very young, hotblooded, idealistic Russian dissidents, modeling themselves on the original 19-century Narodniki whose fiery-minded assassinations inspired Lenin's boldest moves, have taken it upon themselves to assassinate Gorbachev. Buckley has huge fun drawing these youths, their backgrounds, education, and military service (as did Dostoyevsky in drawing his Narodniki in The Devils) and his mastery of the Russian terrain and mentality takes on tremendously entertaining firmness. Black goes to Reagan for a one-on-one confab that must not go out of the Oval Office. Should he turn his buddy Cyclops and the Narodniki over to the KGB? Ronnie stalls, It's not our business. Then he meets Gorbachev at Reykjavik, likes him, and tells Black the Narodniki must go. Heavy-hearted Black takes off for Moscow as the assassins fail at a first attempt and mount a second. His mission: death to the Narodniki.... Top-drawer storytelling, as Blackford scrabbles for his soul. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Acme, and, most recently, Dating Your Mom.These essays, which originated as a series of lectures at the New York Public Library, have been carefully edited by Zinsser ( On Writing Well ) so as to preserve the energy and liveliness of the writers' speech. Although the authors entertain with travel anecdotes, some charming, some hair-raising, their insights into the genre of travel writing are unextraordinary. For Mark Salzman, who taught English in China, a "bleak or beautiful" landscape means nothing "until a person walks into it, and then what interests me is how a person behaves in that place." On a more practical note, Ian Frazier concludes that the only acceptable mode of transportation for seeing the U.S. is a car, even though his driving tour through the Great Plains "sent two and a half tons of carbon into the sunny skies." Because the authors have written elsewhere about their travels, the references here to their experiences feel truncated. Still, these fragments can be engrossing, particularly Tobias Schneebaum's account of a tribe of cannibals in Indonesia. Set down in their midst by helicopter--stark naked so as to better assimilate--Schneebaum knew not whether he would be welcomed and fed or welcomed and eaten. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Speaking of Faith</h2><p>The host of public radio&#39;s Speaking of Faith explores the role of faith in today&#39;s world, drawing on her life experiences and her in-depth conversations with such figures as Elie Wiesel, Karen Armstrong, and Thich Nhat Hanh.</p><p><b>Praise for Krista Tippett and her public radio program <i>Speaking of Faith:</i></b> <br> "The brilliance of Krista Tippett&#x2019;s idea is to trust people to use the first person singular, to commit themselves with passion and clarity as they enlarge our urgent national conversation."<br> &#x2014;Martin Marty, Emeritus Professor of American Religious History, University of Chicago <br><br> "Speaking of Faith isn&#x2019;t just a good idea and a welcome concept for a muchneeded forum on religion, belief and spirituality in contemporary life&#x2014;it already is that forum."<br> &#x2014;Patricia Hampl, Poet, memoirist, and MacArthur "Genius" Grant recipient<b>Krista Tippett</b> is the creator and host of <i>Speaking of Faith</i> from America Public Media, heard on public radio stations across the country and worldwide.

Freeman details both her own angelic encounters and those of other people. Though she is quick to point out that discernment is necessary in interpreting the meaning of possible angelic encounters, she seeks to explain the nature of angels by drawing on both theological sources and her own intuitive perceptions. Her conclusions are speculative because angels (if they exist) do not have material form and thus cannot be subjected to scientific inquiry, but the stories presented provide fascinating glimpses of sometimes miraculous, seemingly divine intervention into people's lives.

The more startling for the economy of its prose and plot, this novel&#39;s story, set among the manicured lawns and euphemisms of Whispering Glades Memorial Park in Hollywood, satirizes the American way of death and offers Waugh&#39;s memento mori. Following the death of a friend, poet and pets&#39; mortician Dennis Barlow finds himself entering into the artificial Hollywood paradise of the Whispering Glades Memorial Park. Within its golden gates, death, American-style, is wrapped up and sold like a package holiday. There, Dennis enters the fragile and bizarre world of Aim�e, the na�ve Californian corpse beautician, and Mr Joyboy, the master of the embalmer&#39;s art... A dark and savage satire on the Anglo-American cultural divide, The Loved One depicts a world where love, reputation and death cost a very great deal. Evelyn Waugh (1903-66) was born in Hampstead, second son of Arthur Waugh, publisher and literary critic, and brother of Alec Waugh, the popular novelist. In 1928 he published his first work, a life of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was soon followed by Vile Bodies (1930), A Handful of Dust (1934) and Scoop (1938). In 1942 he published Put Out More Flags and then in 1945 Brideshead Revisited. Men at Arms (1952) was the first volume of &#39;The Sword of Honour&#39; trilogy, and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize; the other volumes, Officers and Gentlemen and Unconditional Surrender, followed in 1955 and 1961. If you enjoyed The Loved One, you might like Waugh&#39;s Vile Bodies, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;The master of black comedy&#39; Sunday Times &#39;One of the funniest and most significant books of the century&#39; Alice Thomas Ellis, Daily Telegraph</p><p>The prolific Waugh--an English novelist and satirist perhaps best known for <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>--described this slim, vicious comedy as "a little nightmare produced by the unaccustomed high living of a brief visit to Hollywood." The setting is the L.A. funeral industry, where Whispering Glades provides deluxe service to deceased stars and their families, and the Happier Hunting Ground does the same for dead pets. (At Whispering Glades, staff must refer to the corpses only as "Loved Ones.") The industry provides a perfect foil for Waugh's deadpan wit--and an apt metaphor for the movie business.4 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The High King</h2><p>When the sword of dyrnwyn, the most powerful weapon inthe kingdom of Prydain, falls into the hands of Arawn-Death-Lord, Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper, and Prince Gwydion raise an army to march against Arawn's terrible cohorts.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a winter expedition filled with danger, Taran's army arrives at Mount Dragon, Arawn's stronghold.&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in a thrilling confrontation with Arawn and the evil enchantress Achren, Taran is forced to make the most crucial decision of his life.</p><p><b>Lloyd Alexander</b> (1924-2007) was the author of more than forty books for children and adults, including the beloved children&#x2019;s fantasy series, the Chronicles of Prydain, one of the most widely read series in the history of fantasy and the inspiration for the animated Disney film, <i>The Black Cauldron</i>.

Taran, the taller horseman, set his face against the wind and leaned forward in the saddle, his eyes on the distant hills. At his belt hung a sword, and from his shoulder a silver-bound battle horn. His companion Gurgi, shaggier than the pony he rode, pulled his weathered cloak around him, rubbed his frost-nipped ears, and began groaning so wretchedly that Taran at last reined up the stallion. "No, no!" Gurgi cried. "Faithful Gurgi will keep on! He follows kindly master, oh yes, as he has always done. Never mind his shakings and achings! Never mind the droopings of his poor tender head!" Taran smiled, seeing that Gurgi, despite his bold words, was eyeing a sheltering grove of ash trees. "There is time to spare," he answered. "I long to be home, but not at the cost of that poor tender head of yours. We camp here and go no farther until morning." They tethered their mounts and built a small fire in a ring of stones. Gurgi curled up and was snoring almost before he had finished swallowing his food. Though as weary as his companion,Taran set about mending the harness leathers. Suddenly he stopped and jumped to his feet. Overhead, a winged shape plunged swiftly toward him. "Look!" Taran cried, as Gurgi, still heavy with sleep, sat up and blinked. "It's Kaw! Dallben must have sent him to find us." The crow beat his wings, clacked his beak, and began squawking loudly even before he landed on Taran's outstretched wrist. "Eilonwy!" Kaw croaked at the top of his voice. "Eilonwy! Princess! Home!" Taran's weariness fell from him like a cloak. Gurgi, wide awake and shouting joyfully, scurried to unloose the steeds. Taran leaped astride Melynlas, spun the gray stallion about, and galloped from the grove, with Kaw perched on his shoulder and Gurgi and the pony pounding at his heels. Day and night they rode, hardly halting for a mouthful of food or a moment of sleep, urging all speed and strength from their mounts and from themselves, ever southward, down from the mountain valley and across Great Avren until, on a bright morning, the fields of Caer Dallben lay before them once again. &nbsp; <br> From the instant Taran set foot across the threshold, such a commotion filled the cottage that he scarcely knew which way to turn. Kaw had immediately begun jabbering and flapping his wings; Coll, whose great bald crown and broad face shone with delight, was clapping Taran on the back; while Gurgi shouted in glee and leaped up and down in a cloud of shedding hair. Even the ancient enchanter Dallben, who seldom let anything disturb his meditations,hobbled out of his chamber to observe the welcomings. In the midst of it all, Taran could hardly glimpse Eilonwy, though he heard the voice of the Princess very clearly above the din. "Taran of Caer Dallben," she cried, as he strove to draw near her, "I've been waiting to see you for days! After all the time I've been away learning to be a young lady--as if I weren't one before I left--when I'm home at last, you're not even here!" In another moment he was at her side. The slender Princess still wore at her throat the crescent moon of silver, and on her finger the ring crafted by the Fair Folk. But now a band of gold circled her brow, and the richness of her apparel made Taran suddenly aware of his travel-stained cloak and muddy boots. "And if you think living in a castle is pleasant," Eilonwy went on, without a pause for breath, "I can tell you it isn't. It's weary and dreary! They've made me sleep in beds with goosefeather pillows enough to stifle you; I'm sure the geese needed them more than I did--the feathers, that is, not the pillows. And servitors to bring you exactly what you don't want to eat. And washing your hair whether it needs it or not. And sewing and weaving and curtsying and all such I don't even want to think about. I've not drawn a sword for I don't know how long ..." Eilonwy stopped abruptly and looked curiously at Taran. "That's odd," she said. "There's something different about you. It's not your hair, though it does look as if you'd cropped it yourself with your eyes shut. It's--well, I can't quite say. I mean, unless you told someone they'd never guess you were an Assistant Pig-Keeper." Taran laughed fondly at Eilonwy's puzzled frown. "Alas, it's beenlong since last I tended Hen Wen. Indeed, when we journeyed among the folk of the Free Commots, Gurgi and I toiled at nearly everything but pig-keeping. This cloak I wove at the loom of Dwyvach the Weaver-Woman; this sword--Hevydd the Smith taught me the forging of it. And this," he said with a trace of sadness, drawing an earthen bowl from his jacket, "such as it is, I made at the wheel of Annlaw Clay-Shaper." He put the bowl in her hands. "If it pleases you, it is yours." "It's lovely," answered Eilonwy. "Yes, I shall treasure it. But that's what I mean, too. I'm not saying you aren't a good Assistant Pig-Keeper, because I'm sure you're the best in Prydain, but there's something more--" "You speak truth, Princess," put in Coll. "He left us a pig-keeper and comes back looking as if he could do all he set his hand to, whatever." Taran shook his head. "I learned I was neither swordsmith nor weaver. Nor, alas, a shaper of clay. Gurgi and I were already homeward bound when Kaw found us, and here shall we stay." "I'm glad of that," replied Eilonwy. "All anyone knew about you was that you were wandering every which where. Dallben told me you were seeking your parents. Then you met someone you thought was your father but wasn't. Or was it the other way round? I didn't altogether understand it." "There is little to understand," Taran said. "What I sought, I found. Though it was not what I had hoped." "No, it was not," murmured Dallben, who had been watching Taran closely. "You found more than you sought, and gained perhaps more than you know." "I still don't see why you wanted to leave Caer Dallben," Eilonwy began. Taran had no chance to reply, for now his hand was seized and shaken vigorously. "Hullo, hullo!" cried a young man with pale blue eyes and strawcolored hair. His handsomely embroidered cloak looked as though it had been water-soaked, then wrung out to dry. His bootlacings, broken in several places, had been retied in large, straggling knots. "Prince Rhun!" Taran had almost failed to recognize him. Rhun had grown taller and leaner, though his grin was as broad as it had ever been. "King Rhun, actually," the young man answered, "since my father died last summer. That's one of the reasons why Princess Eilonwy is here now. My mother wanted to keep her with us on Mona to finish her education. And you know my mother! She'd never have left off with it, even though Dallben had sent word Eilonwy was to come home. And so," he proudly added, "I finally put my foot down. I ordered a ship fitted out, and off we sailed from Mona Haven. Amazing what a king can do when he sets his mind to it! "We've brought someone else along, too," Rhun continued, gesturing toward the fireside where Taran for the first time noticed a pudgy little man sitting with a cook-pot between his knees. The stranger licked his fingers and wrinkled a flabby nose at Taran. He made no attempt to rise, but only nodded curtly while the scraggly fringe of hair around his bulbous head stirred like weeds under water. Taran stared, not believing what he saw. The little man drewhimself up and sniffed with a mixture of haughtiness and wounded feelings. "One should have no trouble remembering a giant," he said testily. "Remember you?" replied Taran. "How could I not! The cavern on Mona! Last time I saw you, though, you were--bigger, to say the least. But it is you, nevertheless. It is, indeed! Glew!" "When I was a giant," Glew said, "few would have forgotten me so quickly. Unfortunate that things worked out as they did. Now, in the cavern--" "You've started him off again," Eilonwy whispered to Taran. "He'll go on like that until you're fairly wilted, about the glorious days when he used to be a giant. He'll only stop talking to eat, and only stop eating to talk. I can understand his eating, since he lived on nothing but mushrooms for so long. But he must have been wretched as a giant, and you'd think he'd want to forget it." "I knew Dallben sent Kaw with a potion to shrink Glew back to size," Taran answered. "Of what happened to him since then, I've had no word." " <i>That</i>'s what happened to him," said Eilonwy. "As soon as he got free of the cavern, he made his way to Rhun's castle. No one had the heart to turn him away, though he bored us all to tears with those endless pointless tales of his. We took him with us when we sailed, thinking he'd be grateful to Dallben and want to thank him properly. Not a bit of it! We almost had to twist his ears to get him aboard. Now that he's here, I wish we'd left him where he was." "But three of our companions are missing," Taran said, glancingaround the cottage. "Good old Doli, and Fflewddur Fflam. And I had hoped Prince Gwydion might have come to welcome Eilonwy." "Doli sends his best wishes," said Coll, "but we shall have to do without his company. Our dwarf friend is harder to root out of the Fair Folk realm than a stump out of a field. He'll not budge. As for Fflewddur Fflam, nothing can keep him and his harp from any merrymaking, whatever. He should have been here long since." "Prince Gwydion as well," Dallben added. "He and I have matters to discuss. Though you young people may doubt it, some of them are even weightier than the homecomings of a Princess and an Assistant Pig-Keeper." "Well, I shall put this on again when Fflewddur and Prince Gwydion arrive," said Eilonwy, taking the golden circlet from her brow, "just so they can see how it looks. But I won't wear it a moment longer. It's rubbed a blister and it makes my head ache--like someone squeezing your neck, only higher up." "Ah, Princess," Dallben said, with a furrowed smile, "a crown is more discomfort than adornment. If you have learned that, you have already learned much." "Learning!" Eilonwy declared. "I've been up to my ears in learning. It doesn't show, so it's hard to believe it's there. Wait, that's not quite true, either. Here, I've learned this." From her cloak she drew a large square of folded cloth and almost shyly handed it to Taran. "I embroidered it for you. It's not finished yet, but I wanted you to have it, even so. Though I admit it's not as handsome as the things you've made." Taran spread out the fabric. As broad as his outstretched arms, the somewhat straggle-threaded embroidery showed a white, blue-eyed pig against a field of green. "It's meant to be Hen Wen," Eilonwy explained as Rhun and Gurgi pressed forward to study the handiwork more closely. "At first, I tried to embroider you into it, too," Eilonwy said to Taran. "Because you're so fond of Hen and because--because I was thinking of you. But you came out looking like sticks with a bird's nest on top, not yourself at all. So I had to start over with Hen alone. You'll just have to make believe you're standing beside her, a little to the left. Otherwise, I'd never have got this much done, and I did work the summer on it." "If I was in your thoughts then," Taran said, "your work gladdens me all the more. No matter that Hen's eyes are really brown." Eilonwy looked at him in sudden dismay. "You don't like it." "I do, in all truth," Taran assured her. "Brown or blue makes no difference. It will be useful--" "Useful!" cried Eilonwy. "Useful's not the point! It's a keepsake, not a horse blanket! Taran of Caer Dallben, you don't understand anything at all." "At least," Taran replied, with a good-natured grin, "I know the color of Hen Wen's eyes." Eilonwy tossed her red-gold hair and put her chin in the air. "Humph!" she said. "And very likely forgotten the color of mine." "Not so, Princess," Taran answered quietly. "Nor have I forgotten when you gave me this," he added, taking up the battle horn. "Itspowers were greater than either of us knew. They are gone now, but I treasure it still because it came from your hands. "You asked why I sought to know my parentage," Taran went on. "Because I hoped it would prove noble, and give me the right to ask what I dared not ask before. My hope was mistaken. Yet even without it--" Taran hesitated, searching for the most fitting words. Before he could speak again, the cottage door burst open, and Taran cried out in alarm. At the threshold stood Fflewddur Fflam. The bard's face was ashen, his ragged yellow hair clung to his forehead. On his shoulder he bore the limp body of a man. Taran, with Rhun behind him, sprang to help. Gurgi and Eilonwy followed as they lowered the still figure to the ground. Glew, his pudgy cheeks quivering, stared speechless. At the first instant, Taran had nearly staggered at the shock. Now his hands worked quickly, almost of themselves, to unclasp the cloak and loosen the torn jacket. Before him, on the hard-packed earth, lay Gwydion Prince of Don. Blood crusted the warrior's wolf-gray hair and stained his weathered face. His lips were drawn back, his teeth set in battle rage. Gwydion's cloak muffled one arm as though at the last he had sought to defend himself with this alone. "Lord Gwydion is slain!" Eilonwy cried. "He lives--though barely," Taran said. "Fetch medicines," he ordered Gurgi. "The healing herbs from my saddlebags--" He stopped short and turned to Dallben. "Forgive me. It is not for me tocommand under my master's roof. But the herbs are of great power. Adaon Son of Taliesin gave them to me long ago. They are yours if you wish them." "I know their nature and have none that will serve better," Dallben answered. "Nor should you fear to command under any roof, since you have learned to command yourself. I trust your skill as I see you trust it. Do as you see fit." Coll was already hurrying from the scullery with water in a basin. Dallben, who had knelt at Gwydion's side, rose and turned to the bard. "What evil deed is this?" The old enchanter spoke hardly above a whisper, yet his voice rang through the cottage and his eyes blazed in anger. "Whose hand dared strike him?" "The Huntsmen of Annuvin," replied Fflewddur. "Two lives they almost claimed. How did you fare?" he urgently asked Taran. "How did you outride them so quickly? Be thankful it went no worse for you." Taran, puzzled, glanced up at the distraught bard. "Your words have no meaning, Fflewddur." "Meaning?" answered the bard. "They mean what they say. Gwydion would have traded his life for yours when the Huntsmen set upon you not an hour ago." "Set upon me?" Taran's perplexity grew. "How can that be? Gurgi and I saw no Huntsmen. And we have been at Caer Dallben this hour past." "Great Belin, a Fflam sees what he sees!" cried Fflewddur. "A fever is working in you," Taran...</p><h2>The question of Palestine</h2><p>Still a basic and indespensible account of the Palestinian question, updated to include the most recent developments in the Middle East- from the intifada to the Gulf war to the historic peace conference in Madrid.</p><p>c and indespensible account of the Palestinian question, updated to include the most recent developments in the Middle East- from the intifada to the Gulf war to the historic peace conference in Madrid.When it was first published in this country in 1977, this original and deeply provocative book made Palestine the subject of a serious debate--one that is now more critical than ever.</p><h2>COSMIC BANDITOS-V277</h2><p>Cosmic Banditos A Contrabandista&#39;s Quest for the Meaning of Life Author: A. C. Weisbecker. This is A.C. Weisbecker&#39;s rollicking novel of high times and hard times-in which he hilariously chronicles the adventures of a group of pot-smoking, number-crunching banditos-in-hiding. - He begins his story in exile in the wilds of Colombia where he, his faithful dog, High Pockets, and his Bandito buddy Jose (not to mention Legs, a feisty little boa constrictor) are on the lam from every law-enforcement agency in the Western Hemisphere. It&#39;s a sad, almost tragic story, since only months earlier the group was worth millions in cash and high-grade marijuana -- all gone now, along with their Learjet, their yachts, their freewheeling good times and their decidedly unbalanced associates. Cosmic Banditos is, in part, the story of how this dismal decline came to pass. But more importantly it is about the hilarious consequences of Jose&#39;s mugging of a teenage American nymphomaniac (Tina) and her family, vacationing in South America. Indeed it soon becomes apparent that Tina&#39;s Father has the answer to a fairly important question: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE? Certain that Destiny is on their side, and armed with M-16s, rocket launchers, hand grenades and physics texts, Jose, High Pockets and our narrator embark on a quest northward, through predator-infested Bandito strongholds, to Sausalito, California, in search of the one man who can explain WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE. But when all is said and done, when all the shouting and shooting and philosophizing is over, our narrator can only come to the conclusion that Cosmic Banditos is &#34;simply another example of something.</p><p>ALLAN C. WEISBECKER, novelist, screenwriter, memoirist, and surfer, is the author of Cosmic Banditos, In Search of Captain Zero, and Can&#39;t You Get Along With Anyone? A Writer&#39;s Memoir and a Tale of a Lost Surfer&#39;s Paradise. He has written articles for surfing magazines and has collaborated in writing screen and television scripts, including Crime Story and Miami Vice.Foreword<p>An odd occurrence, even by my standards.1<br><br>Picture it this way: You&#x2019;ve offed your home, a comfy if rustic little villa with a wood stove, and deer standing outside the picture window. You&#x2019;ve summarily given up a movie and TV writing career that&#x2019;s been quite good to you over the years, although it currently appears to be going nowhere.2 You&#x2019;ve sold, chucked or given away everything that might impede swift, economical movement and hit the road -- just your dog and you, with no plans to return. <br><br>You&#x2019;ve burned bridges.<br><br>Your former life seems over, <i>kaput</i>. The only apparent meaning to your new life is based on this idea: You&#x2019;re in search of an old friend and sometime partner in crime who vanished into the wilds of Central America five years before. You have little idea of what you&#x2019;re going to say to this guy if and when you track him down &#x2013; although you do have some questions in mind -- or where you might go and what you might do afterward, but that&#x2019;s the plan. <br><br>In some sense, what you&#x2019;re doing is an attempt at making sense of things, of your life. 3<br><br>Truth is, you&#x2019;re about halfway out of your mind. 4<br><br>You&#x2019;re in far southern Mexico now, four months into your bolt. You left in 1996 but it&#x2019;s now 1997. You&#x2019;ve pulled over onto the side of a road labeled Mex 200 on the map. You cut your engine. There&#x2019;s no traffic. It&#x2019;s very quiet. You&#x2019;re staring at a sign indicating a turnoff to a town some distance inland. Motozintla. You&#x2019;re suddenly feeling dizzy and a little disoriented &#x2013; a little <i>more</i> disoriented than usual. You&#x2019;ve seen this word, this name, before. <br><br>Where? <br><br>Had a ring to it when you first saw it. <br><br>You say it aloud. Motozintla. Moe-toe-ZEEN-tlah. <br><br>Still has a ring to it. <br><br>In your mind you travel back in time to 1982. Your life of crime is over, recently abandoned due to ridiculous, though dangerous, circumstances. You&#x2019;re staring at the first page of a composition book. You start writing. Your goal is to make sense of things, of your life. 5<br><br>Before that first session of writing is finished, you find you&#x2019;ve turned back to the first page and printed at the top the words <i>Cosmic Banditos</i>. You don&#x2019;t know where this came from, since you have no real idea of where the story is going. You&#x2019;re completely winging it. About all you&#x2019;ve accomplished so far is the description of a dog. You shrug and press on. <br><br>Back on the roadside in Mexico in 1997, you dimly recall that at some point in the writing you did in 1982 you needed a town in southern Mexico for some things to happen in. You&#x2019;d pulled out a world atlas and searched for a name that has a ring to it. Motozintla. The characters in the story you&#x2019;re writing have an adventure in Motozintla then move on. <br><br>1 The events described in The Forward to the New Edition should be completely viewed as more or less being at least partly true. In other words, as <i>nonfiction</i>. <br><br>2 You don&#x2019;t wish to name the movie studio that caused your career to be going nowhere but it&#x2019;s the one that has cartoon characters on its West Coast corporate headquarters front lawn and that is sometimes referred to as Mousevitz, or Duckenwald, for its Storm Trooper treatment of creative types, especially writers. <br><br>3 You will fail miserably, of course. <br><br>4 A related issue: You are currently trying to get the reader used to the excessive footnoting to come. <br><br>5 You will fail miserably, of course, but in this case with a certain panache. <br><br>2. <br><br>So: You&#x2019;re staring at a sign indicating the turnoff to a place you&#x2019;ve written about as if you&#x2019;d been there but of course had not. You&#x2019;d made everything up, including your physical description of Motozintla. 6 <br><br>But that&#x2019;s not why you&#x2019;re feeling weird. <br><br>You&#x2019;re feeling weird because you&#x2019;re beset by a creeping epiphany. <br><br>The term d�j� vu comes to mind, but it isn&#x2019;t quite accurate. <br><br>How about <i>vuja de</i>? An experience you&#x2019;re sure you&#x2019;ve never had before but gives you the willies anyway, because you may have <i>imagined</i> having it. <br><br>You glance at your dog, sitting beside you in the cab of your pickup truck, looking at you in the way dogs do that asks the question, What&#x2019;s next? <br><br>Normally, the sight of your dog has a calming effect on you, but now the reverse is the case. For the moment, your dog&#x2019;s presence is no help at all. <br><br>Your dog is a big part of your creeping epiphany, your <i>vuja de</i> experience. <br><br>In order to avoid eye contact with your dog, you look out the window, only to find yourself again staring at the Motozintla sign, which sports an arrow pointing off toward the right, to the turnoff. Your sense of dizziness, of increased disorientation, of heightened weirdness, increases further. <br><br>What&#x2019;s going on here? <br><br>This: The tale you wrote in 1982 in order to make sense of things appears to be actually taking place now, fifteen years later. By the way: Although the tale was inspired by real events in your life, the crux of it was not only made up, but essentially nonsensical. 7 <br><br>Yet here you are. <br><br>The hero of your fictional tale is in the throes of a crisis. His former life appears to be over, <i>kaput</i>, due to ridiculous though dangerous circumstances, and he&#x2019;s about halfway out of his mind. Spurred to action by rising dementia, he embarks on a quest, with his dog, through Mexico and Central America, in search of an enigmatic figure who presumably has the answers to some important questions. En route, he comes across various banditos, fugitives, corrupt establishmentarians and all-around lunatics and miscreants.You, while on this real-life quest to find your vanished old chum &#x2013; an enigmatic figure for whom you have some questions -- have encountered various banditos, fugitives, corrupt establishmentarians and all-around lunatics and miscreants. <br><br>The hero of your fictional tale has a peculiar obsession, having to do with the physics of matter and energy. <br><br>You have a peculiar obsession, in practice quite different from that of your fictional hero, but &#x2013; come to think of it -- with identical theoretical roots: the physics of matter and energy. <br><br>One of the essential themes of your fictional tale is the idea that human beings exist in different <i>branches of reality</i>, an unaccountable number of them, and all of them are real. In other words, <i>anything that can happen, will happen, or may have already happened</i>. <br><br>This realization causes you to swallow with an audible gulp.<br><br>6 In your writing, you have an overall cavalier attitude toward geographical veracity. You&#x2019;ve given Bolivia a coastline, for example, because you needed a South American country name that starts with a <i>B</i>, to alliterate with the words <i>bandito</i> and <i>burrito</i>, yet has a coastline. Bolivia, of course, is landlocked. .7 The phrase <i>complete crock of shit</i> comes to mind.. <br><br>3. <br><br>You look at your dog, who is brown with asymmetrical white patches here and there. Her ears are out of alignment and she has a large tongue that always hangs out, giving her a clownish appearance.This is the exact description of your fictional8 hero&#x2019;s canine sidekick. <i>A Clownish appearance</i> are in fact the words you used in that first writing session to sum up the fictional dog&#x2019;s physical attributes. The thought crosses your mind that your real dog9 was born in 1987, five years after you&#x2019;d described the... <i>other dog</i>. Further, this current dog and you teamed up accidently. You did not pick her out of the canine multitudes due to a predilection for brown dogs with asymmetrical white patches here and there, ears out of alignment and large tongues that always hang out. Dogs with <i>clownish appearances</i>. <br><br>In fact, none of what&#x2019;s taking place can be explained by your innate predilections, story telling preferences, or some sort of interconnection between the two. And anyway, remember: The real events are taking place 15 years after the events you made up. <br><br>The word <i>coincidence</i> pops into your mind, then pops right back out again. You thumb through your mental thesaurus but don&#x2019;t come up with anything that accurately defines the situation. 10<br><br>You&#x2019;re still staring at the Motozintla sign. Thinking maybe you should make the turn, follow the arrow11 and pay Motozintla a visit. See who, or what, shows up there &#x2013; or is <i>already</i> there. <br><br>Or maybe not. Maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t go anywhere near the place. <br><br>Out of the corner of your eye, you dimly perceive that the dog sitting beside you is still looking at you with that expression that asks, What&#x2019;s next?<br><br>8 Given the implications of the <i>different branches of reality</i> concept, the usual definition of the word <i>fictional</i> should henceforth (and, as a matter of fact, retroactively) be viewed as suspect. <br><br>9 Better phrasing might be <i>the dog sitting beside you in this branch of reality</i>. <br><br>10 The phrase <i>twist of fate</i> does come close, especially if you add the adjective <i>bizarre</i> to the front.11 The phrase <i>arrow of time</i> occurs to you. <br><br>--Reprinted from Cosmic Banditos by A.

There's the imagination that changes gender and historical epoch at whim, and does so convincingly; and the characters themselves, a sundry bunch of men and women not necessarily successful or commendable but always, somehow, likable. Best of all, by their very diversity, these stories reveal glimpses of the smart and enigmatic woman behind the work.<p> In "Atlantic Crossing," Winterson becomes a middle-aged businessman of the mid-20th century, accidentally assigned to share his second-class cabin with a young black woman on a transatlantic crossing. In the realm of event, little happens, but in its depth of perception and what it tells of the nuances of regret, the story is as rich as a novel in another writer's hands. A few scant pages later, Winterson becomes a kind of lost female Homer, telling Orion's story from Artemis's point of view: "When she returned she saw this huge rag of a man eating her goat, raw.... His reputation hung about him like bad breath." In "The Poetics of Sex," she creates a lesbian love story that evokes her characters' personalities as explicitly as their erotic pleasures. "The 24-Hour Dog," the story of a woman writer returning a puppy she had thought to adopt, is remorseless as a psychological thriller in the squirmy depths it plumbs: "I had made every preparation, every calculation, except for those two essentials that could not be calculated: his heart and mine." Read <i>The World and Other Places</i> twice, once for instruction, once for joy. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>"A brilliant collection. . .speculative, philosophical and surreal. . . . You will fall in love with this writer." --<i>The Baltimore Sun</i><br><br>"Winterson is a grand warrior. . .a modern writer, a modern thinker. . . . Her images are fantastic." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"Like a literary periscope scanning island after island in the sea of Winterson's imagination." --<i>Boston Book Review</i><br><br>"That Winterson is an original and important writer is surely by now beyond question. . . . One of the pleasures of this collection is that it allows the reader to map the gradual evolution of her writing." --<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><h2>No Place for a Puritan: The Literature of California&#39;s Deserts (California Legacy)</h2><p>Feared and romanticized throughout the ages, the desert has a hold on our imagination that is never more evident than in the literature it has inspired. From Mary Austin's meditations in <i>The Land of Little Rain</i> to Joan Didion's acerbic cast of characters in <i>Play It As It Lays</i>, the desert's seemingly barren landscapes have provided rich ground for writers to explore. These explorations have been collected for the first time in <i>No Place for a Puritan</i>. In this anthology are stories that thrill, frighten, sadden, and inspire: a man foolishly and arrogantly collecting live rattlesnakes; a lone woman striving to make a home in a remote desert canyon; a drug-addled journalist's drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas; a Japanese American family coping with incarceration during World War II; and one man's developing friendship with General Patton in a military training camp. There are tales of spiritual and scientific discoveries and of the cities blossoming in the farthest corners of the California desert. Including the works of local writers&#x2014;Susan Straight, Gayle Brandeis, Juan Felipe Herrera, Ruth Nolan, and others&#x2014;as well as household names such as John Steinbeck, Aldous Huxley, Hunter S. Thompson, Jon Krakauer, Rebecca Solnit, and Barry Lopez, <i>No Place for a Puritan</i> is a collection that disturbs and enchants.</p><p>Ruth Nolan is a poet and writer whose works have appeared in many literary magazines and anthologies, including <i>Inlandia: A Literary Journey through California's Inland Empire</i>, which was published by Heyday. A former wildland firefighter for the BLM California Desert District, she holds her B.A. in English from California State University, San Bernardino, and M.A. in English/Creative Writing from Northern Arizona University. She is Associate Professor of English at College of the Desert and lives in Palm Desert.''With voices as varied and untamed, as resilient and beautiful, as the landscape itself, this anthology maps another misunderstood and too often overlooked region of our state.''--Alex Espinoza, author of <i>Still Water Saints</i><p> ''A thrilling and necessary collection.'' --Marisa Silver, author of <i>The God of War</i></p></p><h2>Venice</h2><p>Physical description; 319 p., [16] p. of plates : ill., maps, ports. ; 24 cm.

Don't tell what you know."<br>This is why we have a cleft on our upper lips and remember nothing of where we came from.<br>Toward the end of the last century--in 1978, to be precise--a smooth-lipped boy appeared in the world.<br>He grew up in an ominous time. People had lost the power of belief. Plagues of the spirit swept the world; shapeless anxieties spread like fever, self-hatred was rampant, love was bitterly denounced because it wasn't perfect. Evidence of madness glittered everywhere. The workshops of great nations forged weapons that would destroy the societies that used them. Acid rained from the skies. Rivers putrified. In some places the air was unbreathable. Hucksters sold God on television, and religions were made out of economic theories that didn't work. Tyrants brutalized the people in the name of the people. The new prophets of freedom preached doctrines of selfishness. Knowledge raced far ahead of wisdom. Mankind worshipped facts, but facts couldn't explain the misfortunes that counterweight the blessings of human life. There were machines that could think, and people numbed their minds to keep themselves from thinking. In their deepest dreams men stood within stone circles and saw a darkness darker than dark.<br>Such epochs of desolation had cursed human history a thousand times before. And, each time, a smooth-lipped mortal was born. These men lived strange, obsessed lives. Some of them lie buried in great mausoleums. Others rotted on the hangman's tree. Some will be remembered forever. Others disappeared into dust and oblivion.<br>When the time of dementia and sorrow came to the late twentieth century, Bentley Ellicott was born with a twisted leg in Stonehaven on the northern coast. Why he was created as a cripple, why he appeared in a peaceful place far from the world's worst torments, will remain mysteries forever. Bentley Ellicott himself was the only person in the world who knew the purpose of his life. It was a secret. He didn't tell anybody until he was eight years old.<br>Stonehaven lies on a sheltered curve of the northern coast, between islands dense with pine trees and a distant river spanned by a bridge shaped like a humpbacked monster's bones. The weather on this coast can be dramatic. Storms burst from turrets of clouds on the uplands and send volleys of thunder rolling across the wind-lashed sea. In winter Stonehaven is entombed in ice, bitter cold, and silence. The fogs of spring and autumn blur the shapes of the village, the forests, the coast.<br>In the time of Bentley Ellicott's childhood, Main Street was a potholed, two-lane way that passed the drugstore, the police station, and the bank. The masts of sailboats swayed with the harbor's lazy swell, and sea gulls wheeled and cried above lobster boats and draggers unloading at the town wharf. There were a freezing plant, a boathouse, and a sardine cannery.<br>The Stonehaven House Hotel stood at the end of Main Street. Years before, when the village shipped granite in waterline schooners to hot cities down the coast, the Stone-haven House Hotel had been fashionable. But the granite quarries had been closed for years by the time Bentley Ellicott was born. The hotel was a white, peeling ruin with broken windows. Tall grass grew all around it. Nobody lived there except Charlie Feavey. He had inherited the hotel from his father. Charlie was a scrawny man with dirty fingernails who was always desperate for money.<br>Potato fields lay north of the village. Along a wooded strip of shoreline--which everybody called the point--Victorian summer houses overlooked the sea and the seaward islands. After the middle of the last century, young couples like Richard and Dorothy Ellicott winterized the old houses and lived in them all year round. Richard was a mathematics professor at the university sixteen miles inland. Bentley Ellicott was born on the point.<br>Odd circumstances surrounded his birth.<br>His beautiful young mother died that night--for no reason the doctors could discover. A jade-eyed stranger named Willybill appeared in Stonehaven as the cold November light was going down. Toward midnight a choppy wind came up out of nowhere and changed directions four times, as if the power behind it were searching for something. McGraw, the Stonehaven police chief, said later that on the night of Bentley's birth he felt as if he and the village were under a glass bell and that a terrible pressure was trying to break through.<br>Bentley's father retreated into a deep depression after his wife died. Richard Ellicott drove to and from the university every day. But he aged faster than his life proceeded. He slept and read too much. He took long, solitary walks along the shore north of the village. He felt abandoned. He loved Bentley, but, as the boy was growing up, Richard couldn't emerge from his grief and pay attention to him.<br>So, Stonehaven's Congregationalist minister, the Reverend Homer Tally, became Bentley's substitute father. He was a gentle man of fifty who rarely spoke above a murmur except when he preached. Everybody regarded Mr. Tally as a saint. He had no children of his own, and he adored Bentley. Reverend Tally taught the boy how to ride a bicycle and plant gardens.<br>Mrs. Tally was not regarded as a saint. Her tart manner, closed mind, and barbed commentaries on the lives of everyone in the village made people tense. As the years progressed she sensed a mystery within Bentley--she was decidedly not stupid--and told everyone the boy was peculiar. He was always wandering off alone in the woods when he was little and search parties had to be organized. That proved his oddity so far as Mrs. Tally was concerned.<br>In the midmorning of his life, when he was eight, Bentley Ellicott's wiry body could scarcely contain his spirit, which was iridescent as summer light on the water. He was as busy as the foragings of a million bees and as curious as the eternal demand to know the meaning of God's wink.<br>He was short for his age and had large, dark eyes. His brown hair hung over those eyes until a German graduate student named Helga became Richard Ellicott's housekeeper. Even Helga had a hard time getting Bentley to sit still long enough for an attack on his hair with scissors. Helga was a slender, pretty girl of nineteen. She teased Bentley to make him screech, wrestled his blue jeans and sneakers off of him so she could wash them, and tried to make him stop gobbling his breakfast.<br>Bentley was irrepressible. He had the energy of a chipmunk, and his face was as changeable as the weather on the northern coast. He bulged out his eyes as he exaggerated his triumphs and failures. He did a terrific imitation of a chimpanzee, bouncing around in circles and scratching his ribs. Other children liked him because he was exuberant and made up interesting games and adventures. In school he fidgeted and shot up his hand and often had the right answers because he loved to learn. He could run in a hopping stumble, but because of his deformed right leg he couldn't run fast enough to play baseball. Baseball was Bentley's favorite thing. He practiced throwing until he was better at it than any kid in Stonehaven. He could knock a tin can off a stump from thirty feet away.<br>Joe Persis, who was Bentley's best friend, was a year older and a lot bigger. He had a dim mind--which is often the mind that sees the obvious truth everyone else misses. He, too, thought that Bentley was different. Bentley was the leader, but he never made Joe feel dumb.<br>They were beach and forest prowlers. They dug clams with their bare hands. Joe climbed trees and pulled Bentley up after him. They made a catapult by laying a board across a log, putting rocks on one end, and jumping on the other. They hauled a U.S. Navy ammunition crate out of the water, quarreled about who owned it, and made up.<br>In his room Bentley had posters depicting birds, fishes, and dinosaurs. He had a toy box half filled with treasures he found along the shore. Sometimes in the evenings he watched television with Helga and her boyfriend. Bentley would pull his sweater up over his eyes when there were scary parts of horror movies. On other evenings he had supper at the Tally's house and rode home on his bicycle. Reverend Tally took him exploring on the uplands of bare meadows, granite outcroppings, forests, and crater lakes that rise behind Stonehaven and the coast. Bentley became a substitute for the son Reverend Tally never had. Mrs. Tally endured him.<br>McGraw, the Stonehaven police chief, didn't like Bentley. He was the one who'd had to lead all the search parties when Bentley had gotten himself lost. He told the other loungers in the Stonehaven drugstore that the kid was a fool. Willybill, the jade-eyed stranger who had appeared in the village on the night Bentley was born, was still there, still a stranger. He watched the boy.<br>Bentley Ellicott kept his secret. He tore around the village and the countryside on his bicycle, yelled his head off at schoolyard baseball games, and reveled in his child-hood despite the fact that his mother was dead, his father was unreachable, and he himself was handicapped.<br>Our fortunes and lives seem chaotic when they are looked at as facts. There is order and meaning only in the great truths believed by everybody in that older, wiser time of the world when things were less known but better understood. That ancient wisdom lived secretly within Bentley Ellicott alongside the rackety personality of an eight-year-old boy. He assumed that the great purpose for which he had been born would not summon him for years and years.<br>* * *<br>No sound ever disappears. Every wind rush stays, every rattle of wave-washed gravel remains in the world, hovering above the gray boulders and rock ledges, dripping with the mists of spring in the pine forests. All of Stonehaven's history murmurs and speaks in the second air--the shouts of Vikings sailing down the cold sea, the rigging creaks of the ships that brought the first French settlers, the rifle cr...In the vein of works by Tolkien and Terry Brooks, Prince Ombra is a basic fantasy of good vs. evil. Its twist is that the champion of good is a crippled eight-year-old boy.

(Amartya Sen <i>New York Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>History of the English Calvinistic Baptists 1771-1892</h2><p>The aim of this book is to trace the story of the English Calvinistic Baptists from the death of John Gill in 1771 to that of Charles Haddon Spurgeon in 1892. It deals not only with the well-known figures in this community's history- theological giants like John Gill, Andrew Fuller, William Gadsby, and Charles Spurgeon- but also with lesser-known lights-men like the hymn writer Benjamin Beddome, the eccentric John Collett Ryland, Abraham Booth, and John Stevens. Wide and deep reading in the writings of these men has given Dr. Robert Oliver an excellent grasp of their various theological perspectives.<br> No Christian community is without its controversies and the Calvinistic Baptists in the period covered by this book are no exception. Even-handedly and with one eye always on the Calvinistic Baptist roots in the seventeenth century- well summed up by The Second London Confession of Faith- the author details the controversies that at times wracked this community. Who may take the Lord's Supper? What is the role of the law in the Christian life? Is there biblical warrant for making free offers of the gospel to all and sundry? None of these issues are minor matters and should not be ignored by Christians today. The thinking of these Baptist worthies is therefore still of great value.<br> Unlike some contemporary historians, Robert Oliver is rightly convinced that the devlopment of the Strict and Particular strand of this community in the nineteenth century is not a stagnant backwater that is best forgotten. Even though the churches of this persuasion were not as balanced as their seventeenth and eighteenth-century forebears, there was a spiritual vitality to this group that needs remembering and Oliver has given us a rich overview of the thought and activities of these English Calvinistic Baptists.</p><p>Robert W. Oliver was born into a Christian home in Bethersden Kent, England in 1936. From infancy he was brought up to attend the local Particular Baptist Chapel with which his mother s family had been associated since the early nineteenth century. Converted through family and church teaching in childhood he was baptized in 1954 at the Bethersden Church.<br><br>National service in the Royal Air Force from 1954 to 1956 took him away from his home district for the first time. This was followed by studies at University College, London where he graduated with BA Honours in History in 1959. This was followed by a year s study in the University of Nottingham leading to a Post Graduate Certificate in Education. He then began a teaching career in secondary education in Gloucestershire.<br><br>He was by this time conscious of a call to the Christian ministry and entered upon a part time pastorate in Cheltenham 1964 1967. His thinking had been profoundly influenced by the teaching of Martyn Lloyd-Jones while a student in London and thus had moved from the original Hyper-Calvinism in which he had been reared.<br><br>In 1971 he commenced a pastorate at the Old Baptist Chapel, Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire. This continued until retirement in 2006. During this pastorate he completed a research course leading to a PhD through the London Bible College. On completion he was asked to be lecturer in Church History and Historical Theology at the London Theological Seminary, a post he continues to hold.'A...masterful book.' --<i><strong>Dr. Michael Haykin</strong></i><br><br>'...A fine piece of work, which I greatly enjoyed reading.' --<i><strong>David P.

Heightening the stakes, these aren&#x2019;t just any seniors--these are three popular, college-bound girls from good families. Set in an insular, tightly knit community in Maine, <i>Not My Daughter</i> explores the consequences of pact behavior on a small town, as well as the strain placed on mothers and daughters who find themselves in unfamiliar terrain. One of the pregnant teens is the daughter of the high school principal--a former teen mother herself--and the local school board is quick to assign blame.

That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.</p> <p>Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from California's subdivisions, where the business was born, to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike, where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. Along the way, he unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate.</p></p><p>On any given day, one out of four Americans opts for a quick and cheap meal at a fast-food restaurant, without giving either its speed or its thriftiness a second thought. Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems as American, and harmless, as apple pie. But the industry's drive for consolidation, homogenization, and speed has radically transformed America's diet, landscape, economy, and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways. Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating expos� with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. Quickly, however, he moves behind the counter with the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world's largest flavor company) and "what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns." Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--feces in your meat. <p> Schlosser's investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of federal oversight of a seemingly lawless industry. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting, and unsanitary practices that introduce <i>E. coli</i> and other pathogens into restaurants, public schools, and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry "both feeds and feeds off the young," insinuating itself into all aspects of children's lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. "Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behavior," he writes. Where to begin? Ask yourself, is the true cost of having it "your way" really worth it? <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>HarperPerennial paperback, 2002 Previous ISBN 9780060838584 <p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2001, Previous ISBN 9780395977897</p></p><h2>Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons</h2><p><p>The average person will speak 123,205,750 words in a lifetime.

From his earliest imperial campaigns, these troops provided played a key role as Napoleon swept from victory to victory and in 1809 their fighting abilities were crucial to the campaign. With Napoleon&#39;s French troops depleted and debilitated after the long struggle in the Spanish War, the German troops for the first time played a major combat role in the centre of the battle line.Aiming at a union of German states under French protection to replace the decrepit Holy Roman Empire, Napoleon sought to expand French influence in central Germany at the expense of the Austrian and Prussian monarchies, ensuring Frances own security. The campaign Napoleon waged in 1809 was his career watershed. He suffered his first reverse at Aspern. Victory was achieved at Wagram was not the knock-out blow he had envisaged.In this epic work, John Gill presents an unprecedented and comprehensive study of this year of glory for the German soldiers fighting for Napoleon, When combat opened they were in the thick of the action, fighting within French divisions and often without any French support at all. They demonstrated tremendous skill, courage and loyalty.</p><p>John H.

A superb aid to strengthening and deepening the spiritual life, each chapter begins with a prayer, lucidly discusses a divine aspect -- from God's infinity to God's love -- and relates that aspect to today's world, while pointing always to God's wonder and inscrutability.</p><p>A. W. Tozer asserts that the cause of many of our modern spiritual woes is the loss in today's church of a lofty concept of God. He argues persuasively that the cure lies in our rediscovery of God's majesty. "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us," he writes. "The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion, and man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God." <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em> bearseloquent witness to the concept of God's majesty, encourages reverent meditation on the being of God, and offers a way to bring back spiritual power to our lives.</p>Although he never received any formal theological training, A.W. Tozer was the author of over forty books on Christian faith and spirituality, and was editor of Alliance Life, the denominational publication of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, in whose churches he ministered and preached. He died in 1963.</p><h2>Food and Spirits</h2><p>Eight stories deal with homecoming, endurance, loss, grief, tradition, and survival</p><p>The plot devices in these eight short stories sometimes seem taken from a notebook for the politically correct: disenfranchised Native Americans, a young man returning home to die of AIDS, a battered wife, a lesbian alcoholic mother who loses custody of her child. Never mind. Author Brant, a Mohawk and Canadian who has lived much of her life in Michigan, avoids the traps she's set for herself. She has a deft feel for that hardest of arts to master: characterization. Her people, revealed to us through subtleties of dialogue and action, become so real it's impossible to regard them as metaphors. Brant's strength is not for dramatic action and the two stories that rely on it 'Wild Turkeys " and "This Place" suffer for it. The strongest stories here play to the author's strength: a talent for capturing the shining moments of ordinary life. In "Home Coming" a dying heron serves as the burning glass in which past and present meet. In 'A Death in the Family, " a young girl struggles with lipstick and hairbrush to make her mother as beautiful in death as in life. In "Swimming Upstream " a former alcoholic watches a battered salmon leap from rock to rock and glimpses her dead son's face in the magic glide of dark waters. Simple language, powerful. images, good work. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Most of these sensitive, engaging tales set in Canada explore the private tragedies and triumphs of Native Americans. The exception, "This Is History," offers a woman-focused account of the origins of Turtle Island (the Earth) in which Sky Woman (the moon) and her daughter/companion First Woman share the "naming" tasks central to creation tales. In "Wild Turkeys," a woman visiting her hometown is shaken when a chance encounter brings back vivid memories of an abusive relationship she fled. The title story tells of 80-year-old Elijah Powless, determined to see his twin granddaughters in the "big city." Armed only with innocent charm and a bag of homemade fry bread, he travels to Detroit, making friends and allies of all whom he meets. Several of Brant's ( The Mohawk Trail ) stories consider the need to come to terms with death: in "This Place," a medicine man whose "good medicine" ranges from butter tarts and old Hank Williams songs to a snakeskin and chanting helps a gay man afflicted with AIDS find the courage to "see death coming and run to meet it." <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fallen Sentinel: Australian Tanks in World War II</h2><p>Against the backdrop of the sweeping conquest of Western Europe by Hitler&#39;s mighty Panzer Divisons in WWII, Australia produced 66 cruiser tanks - the Sentinel tank - but none ever took the field of battle. The story of Australian tanks in WWII portrays governments under pressure and bureaucratic bungles that saw opportunities lost and precious resources squandered when the nation was under greatest threat. This careful dissection of government process in the crucible of war is a rare gem in an age when most wartime histories focus on the front-line soldier.</p><p>Peter Beale served as a troop leader in the 9th Royal Tank Regiment in Normandy and the north-west Europe campaign in 1944-45, during which he was wounded twice. After demobilisation he obtained a degree in electrical engineering at University College, London. He emigrated to Australia in 1956, where he worked as a management consultant.

Set in the blossoming frontier town of Austin, <em>The Borderland</em> focuses on the lives of Romulus and Cullasaja Swift, the half-Cherokee offspring of two forward-thinking parents who have come to Texas from New York; of Henry Longfellow, a rapacious lawyer; and of Captain Matthew Caldwell, a Texas Ranger whose eccentric ways are matched only by his fierce bravery.</p><p>Everybody knows the story of the Alamo and the Texas victory over the Mexican army at San Jacinto, but the dramatic period that followed--the years when the Republic of Texas was not yet part of the United States--has largely been ignored. Edwin Shrake's novel makes up for that. <i>The Borderland</i> is set in 1839, three years after the Alamo fell. The fledgling Republic is down on its heels, desperate for money, short on organization, lacking structure and infrastructure, and still at war with Mexico. President Lamar, as much a poet as a politician, has a plan, though: by expanding the Republic to the Pacific, he can attract the frenzy--and cash--of land speculators. He begins by going up against his enemy, Sam Houston, and moving the capital of the Republic inland from Houston to a pristine river valley in central Texas--Comanche country--that gives birth to the new city of Austin. The repercussions are enormous. To begin with, it sets off the largest Comanche war party of all time. <p> Weaving together a marvelous cast of characters, some real, some wholly created, Shrake renders a strong, often eerie portrait of life on the frontier and the horrors of frontier warfare. As Texas Ranger Captain Matthew Caldwell, known as "Old Paint" because of his spotted beard, leads a desperate, ragtag force against the Comanche warriors on the plains south of Austin, Romulus Swift, a half-Cherokee physician descended from Jonathan Swift, falls in love with Caldwell's young German Jewish immigrant bride. Swift is a mystical character--he's on a quest to find a mysterious, otherworldly-wise creature said to live in a cave full of Spanish gold; Caldwell is more a straight-ahead force of nature. When the two men, suspicious of each other from the get-go, must journey together into Comancheria, the palpable tension has as much to do with whether they'll kill each other as it does with whether they'll be able to make a truce with 2,000 Comanche warriors ready to wipe Austin out. Add to the mix Swift's sister, anxious to return to her Native American past after a society life in New York, and Henry Longfellow, a powerful, misogynistic, slave-holding politician who may be Texas's first serial killer, and <i>The Borderland</i> has the makings of a truly tall tale. Massive in scope, captivating in detail, and meticulous in its resurrection of history, Shrake's novel exhumes a forgotten era of Texas's past. <i>--Roland Gregory</i></p>Novelist and screenwriter <strong>Edwin Shrake</strong> is the co-author of the best-selling sports book of all time, <em>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book</em>.

He lives in Austin, Texas.</p><h2>God Is All Joy: The Life of St. Teresa of the Andes</h2><p>Teresa of Jesus of the Andes, Chile's first canonized saint, was a vibrant young woman who loved sports and music and had a wide circle of friends. She entered Carmel and died only eleven months later at the age of nineteen. Each year more than 100,000 visitors flock to her shrine, many of them young people. What is it about this young woman, barely out of school, that draws so many people to her and that is so outstanding that she is now a canonized saint? Because she is one of them, her own people love her. Young people love her because she became a saint by living the same sort of life as they do, in school, playing sports, enjoying her friends, and through it all, living her faith to the full.<br>Teresa's schooling demonstrates a thorough grounding, not only in theology, but also in philosophy, logic, and the humanities. Even more importantly, it was at the same time informed by a fervent and disciplined spiritual life centered on the sacraments and above all on the presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Theologians, reading the writings of this nineteen year old girl, are amazed at the profound, reasoned and clear understanding she had of her faith, a faith that was alive, set on fire by her total love for God. Teresa's life bears witness that a life totally lived for the love of Christ is radiant, joyous and life-expanding.<br><br>Jennifer Moorcroft tells this remarkable story for English-speaking readers so that they too may catch the fire of the love of God from St. Teresa of the Andes and find the joy and happiness that living in the love of God gives.</p><p></p><h2>Roget&#39;s Pocket Thesaurus</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Drawing on cutting-edge research and thirty-five years of experience as a therapist, he carefully builds a case for why we need to move away from seeing shame as a single and toxic emotion and, instead, understand it as a complex of emotions which, counterintuitively, can help us embrace our true selves and experience greater joy in living. Burgo is a fine storyteller with great empathy, and the stories of patients (and, yes, his own) vividly demonstrate how facing shame is the well-spring of true respect and pride in the self. His argument is by the far the most cogent in explaining why the notion of self-esteem being founded in constant praise and lack of criticism is both wrong-headed and ultimately destructive. Step by step, Burgo shows us both how to give voice to the feelings of shame that have been holding us back and to bolster our ability to identify what we&#x2019;re feeling with precision. On every page, but especially in the unique exercises at the end, <i>Shame </i>encourages us again and again to look not just at what shames us but why it does and to face both squarely. It&#x2019;s a book I will recommend to my readers without a single reservation.

Tour.</p><p>Everyone knows that Washington is completely out of touch with the rest of the country. Now Kevin Phillips, whose bestselling books have prophesied the major watersheds of American party politics, tells us why. Washington - mired in bureaucracy, captured by the money power of Wall Street, and dominated by 90,000 lobbyists, 60,000 lawyers, and the largest concentration of special interests the world has ever seen - has become the albatross that Thomas Jefferson and our other Founding Fathers feared: a swollen capital city feeding off the country it should be governing. Throughout most of our history, the genius of American politics was that ballot revolutions every generation swept out failed establishments and created new ones. Now that can no longer happen. Feared and even hated by a majority of the citizenry, &#34;Permanent Washington&#34; has dug in. Using history as a chilling warning, Kevin Phillips parallels the present atrophy to that of formerly mighty and arrogant capitals like Rome, Madrid, and Amsterdam. Unchecked, Washington will - like other great powers before it - lead the country to its inevitable decline and fall. To work again, Washington must be purged and revitalized. In his unique blueprint for a political upheaval, Kevin Phillips puts Washington on notice by sounding a cry for immediate action, offering us a wide variety of remedies - some quasi-revolutionary, others more moderate, but all sure to be controversial.A blistering jeremiad that gives new vibrancy to the political clich&#x201a; that Washington is out of touch with the average American. At first glance, it would seem that any book rehashing this idea, even calling for a Jeffersonian-style electoral revolution, is hardly onto anything new. But Phillips (The Politics of Rich and Poor, 1990) is a brilliant reader of the political tea leaves; this seasoned Washington observer more than compensates for boiler-plate populism with a steady accretion of detail and provocative historical comparisons. For instance, he not only notes how parasitic the Beltway has become, but catalogues it with alarming data: the capital is overrun, he states, by 40,00050,000 lawyers, 90,000 lobbyists, a Congressional staff of 20,000, and 12,000 journalists. Phillips also finds novel examples of ``the capital's intermingling of public service, loose money, vocational incest, overinflated salaries, and ethical flexibility.'' One instance is what he calls ``loophole nepotism,'' the congressional practice of putting relatives on a colleague's payroll. Former assets of the American tradition have become liabilities, he thinks, including a separation of powers that discourages cooperation and responsibility, and a labyrinthine framework with 83,000 state, county, and city government subdivisions. Moreover, the government's inability to regulate electronic financial speculation has exposed the middle class to the decline of the manufacturing sector and even white-collar downsizing. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are willing to reform the mess since they feed at the special-interest trough. Phillips draws useful parallels with three capitals once afflicted with unproductive hangers-on: Madrid in the 1590s, the Hague in the 1690s, and London in the 1890s. He calls for reform measures ranging from the quixotic (periodically moving Congress out of the capital) to the sensible (the elimination of incentives for lawyers and lobbyists). Unusually wise to the dodges of Washington's rich and powerful. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Situated on a flood plain between Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, the Columbia river reclaimed the city for its own in a flood on Memorial day 1948. In its brief but vital lifetime, Vanport pushed the Portland area into a new era of change and development, leaving a legacy that is felt even today. During its time, Vanport was the largest housing project in the United States (perhaps the world) and the second largest city in Oregon. It provided twenty-four hour day-care for the children living there, laid the foundations for Portland State University through its Vanport Extension Center, and provided housing for the thousands of new workers attracted to the city of Portland by the shipyards. A planner&#39;s dream and at times a tenant&#39;s nightmare, Vanport affected much more than its immediate occupants during its limited lifetime. Manly Maben has written a comprehensive history of the project, combing through Housing Authority of Portland records and interviewing the people that made Vanport hum. He takes the reader through daily life and its hurdy-gurdy qualities, schools, race relations, the public image of Vanport, its political ups and downs, its final obliteration by floodwaters, and the aftermath of the project&#39;s destruction. Vanport encapsulated the changes that occurred in American society during World War II. As one of the government&#39;s most ambitious attempts at social planning, VANPORT is essential reading for students of urban planning, or for those who simply want to preserve the memory of a dynamic chapter in the history of the Pacific Northwest.

Let's hope so, because <i>The Authority: Relentless</i> retools old ideas for a new century. Warren Ellis has his heroes think globally as they kick butt locally, stopping or slowing down to consider how they can use their powers to "make the world a better place." How he can pull this off in our oh-so-ironic age is an artistic mystery, but the results are clear: superheroes with believable personalities <i>and</i> community spirit. Two story arcs, each encompassing terror and evil on a global scale, pit the group of seven against armies of superhumans dispatched in scenes reminiscent of the best action movies. Many of the characters from the older StormWatch series reappear here, and fans will be pleased to learn that Ellis has, if anything, improved his depth and storytelling prowess. Bryan Hitch's penciling, Paul Neary's inking, and Laura Depuy's coloring are all equally responsible for the gloriously lovely artwork-- from interdimensional spaceships to dismembered spinal cords, they make saving the world beautiful. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Warren Ellis is the acclaimed writer of Transmetropolitan, Hellblazer and Planetary.

This outstanding illustrated version adds to Sir Thomas Malory's skillful recounting with original artwork that creates a unique vision of Camelot. Some of these breathtaking, elaborate watercolors and pens-and-inks have hung in museums, including the depiction of the Tintagel Castle, the Sword in the Stone, Merlin and Nimue, and Guenevere rescued from the stake. With remarkable accuracy, Anna-Marie Ferguson captures every nuance of the historical period-the knights' shining armor, the intricate architecture, and the English forests with their abundant flora and fauna. Yet she also revels in the fantasy, with mysterious and magical landscapes, misty and moonlit. These legends have always been a treat for the mind-and now they are a feast for the eyes, too.<br></p><p>There has been humour, heartbreak, and breathtaking visions, and the continuous excitement of trying to capture the beauty of Malory&#39;s scenes in watercolour. In the quietest moments, I liked to imagine ghosts roosting in my studio - from distant figures who may have existed and inspired the legend, to the storytellers, artists, and their creations that have served it. There are rewards in such good company and I feel most privileged to have contributed to a tradition so close to my heart, and served a world of such beauty.....beauty with a serrated edge. Anna Marie FergusonThe legends of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table have inspired some of the greatest works of literature--from Cervantes's Don Quixote to Tennyson's Idylls of the King. Although many versions exist, Malory's stands as the classic rendition. Malory wrote the book while in Newgate Prison during the last three years of his life; it was published some fourteen years later, in 1485, by William Caxton. The tales, steeped in the magic of Merlin, the powerful cords of the chivalric code, and the age-old dramas of love and death, resound across the centuries. <br>The stories of King Arthur, Lancelot, Queen Guenever, and Tristram and Isolde seem astonishingly moving and modern. Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings for brotherhood and community, a love worth dying for, and valor, honor, and chivalry.</p><h2>Poverty and the Poor Law in Ireland, 1850-1914 (Reappraisals in Irish History LUP)</h2><p>The focus of this study is the poor law system, and the people who used it. Introduced in 1838, the Irish poor law established a nationwide system of poor relief that was administered and financed locally. This book provides the first detailed, comprehensive assessment of the ideological basis and practical operation of the poor law system in the post-Famine period. Analysis of contemporary understandings of poverty is integrated with discussion of local relief practices to uncover the attitudes and responses of those both giving and receiving relief, and the active relationship between them. Local case studies are used to explore key issues such as entitlement and eligibility, as well as the treatment of 'problem' groups such as unmarried mothers and vagrants, thus allowing local and individual experience to enrich our understanding of poverty and welfare in historical context. Previous studies of poverty and welfare in Ireland have concentrated on the measures taken to relieve poverty, and their political context. Little attempt has been made to explore the experience of being poor, or to identify the strategies adopted by poor people to negotiate an inhospitable economic and social climate. This innovative interrogation of poor law records reveals the poor to have been active historical agents making calculated choices about how, when and where to apply for aid. Approaching welfare as a process, the book provides a deeper and more wide ranging assessment of the Irish poor law than any study previously undertaken and represents a major milestone in Irish economic and social history.<br></p><p><br>Virginia Crossman was Professor of Modern Irish History at Oxford Brookes University until her retirement.<br>"This is an important and timely book.

Married to a demon wife and surrounded by wary colleagues, he is nevertheless bored with investigating routine exorcism scams and bogus feng shui licenses. Then the newly deceased ghost of a wealthy industrialist's daughter fails to make her appointed arrival in Heaven. When it quickly becomes obvious that the industrialist himself is implicated in a netherworldly soul-trafficking scheme and is responsible for his daughter's death, Chen has to work with an unlikely sidekick, Zhu Irzh, one of Hell's own vice detectives and a demon cursed with a conscience. Twice nominated for Philip K.

Although Philadelphia rarely appears in histories of the modern civil rights struggle, the city was home to a vibrant and groundbreaking movement for racial justice in the years between World War II and the 1970s. By broadening the chronological and geographic parameters of the civil rights movement, <i>Up South</i> explores the origins of civil rights liberalism, the failure of the liberal program of antidiscrimination legislation and interracial coalition-building to deliver on its promise of racial equality, and the subsequent rise of the Black Power movement.</p><p>The Philadelphia movement occurred in three stages. During the 1940s and 1950s, liberal civil rights groups in the city successfully campaigned for Philadelphia's new City Charter to be the first in the nation to include a ban on racial discrimination in municipal employment, services, and contracts. Within a decade, however, black activists in the city were leading consumer boycotts and street protests against the city's liberal establishment for failing to overcome entrenched structures of racial inequality in labor markets, residential neighborhoods, and public schools. These protests set the stage both for some of the earliest experiments in affirmative action and for the emergence of the Black Power movement in Philadelphia.</p><p>Challenging the view that it was the inflammatory rhetoric of Black Power and the rising demands of black activists that derailed the civil rights movement, <i>Up South</i> documents the efforts of Black Power activists in Philadelphia to construct a vital and effective social movement that combined black nationalism's analysis of racism's constitutive role in American society with a program of grassroots community organizing and empowerment. On issues ranging from public education and urban renewal to police brutality and welfare, Philadelphia's Black Power movement remade the city's political landscape. And, in contrast to the top-down middle-class leadership of traditional civil rights groups, Black Power in Philadelphia fundamentally altered the composition of black leadership in the city to include a new cohort of neighborhood-based working-class and female black community activists.</p></p><p><b>Matthew J.

To substantiate his argument, he gives an honest hermeneutical appraisal of Christ&#39;s teaching in the Olivet Discourse (Matt. 24; Lk. 21; Mk. 13) as well as other places in the Gospels, and gives a topical commentary on the book of Revelation - all this to successfully demonstrate that these events find their fulfillment in our past, not in our future. Perhaps you disagree - you chuckle as you read this and asseverate in your mind that such a teaching is manifestly impossible. Yet, have you ever read the arguments? Challenged your own? Don&#39;t shy away from this great book! Let it challenge you! If, after reading, you still disagree... fine.

They were born in a small village in Algeria to a German father and an Algerian mother, and raised by an elderly uncle in one of the toughest ghettos in France. But the similarities end there. Rachel is a model immigrant&#x2014;hard working, upstanding, law-abiding. Malrich has drifted. Increasingly alienated and angry, a bleak future seems inevitable for him. But when Islamic fundamentalists murder the young men's parents in Algeria the destinites of both brothers are transformed. Rachel discovers the shocking truth about his family and buckles under the weight of the sins of his father, a former SS officer. Now Malrich, the outcast, will have to face that same awful truth alone. <br><br> Banned in the author's native Algeria for of the frankness with which it confronts several explosive themes, <i>The German Mujahid</i> is a truly groundbreaking novel. For the first time, an Arab author directly addresses the moral implications of the Shoah. But this richly plotted novel also leaves its author room enough to address other equally controversial issues like Islamic fundamentalism and Algeria's "dirty war" of the early 1990s, for example; or the emergence of grim Muslim ghettos in France's low-income housing projects. In this gripping novel, Boualem Sansal confronts these and other explosive questions with unprecedented sincerity and courage.</p><p><b>Boualem Sansal </b>was born in 1949 in Algeria. Since the publication of his debut novel, <i>Le serment des barbares</i>, which was awarded the Best First Novel Prize in France in 1999, he has been widely considered one of his country's most important contemporary authors. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Algiers.Two immigrant brothers discover the truth about their German father's past in this masterly investigation of evil, resistance and guilt, billed as the first Arab novel to confront the Holocaust. Narrator Malrich, the younger son of a German father and an Algerian mother, lives with relatives in a gritty, mostly Arab housing estate outside Paris. Malrich is an indifferent hoodlum while his older brother, Rachel, has a university degree and a glamorous job at a multinational. The plot hinges on Malrich's reading of Rachel's diary after Rachel commits suicide. After their parents were murdered in Algeria in 1994, Rachel discovered that their father was a Waffen SS officer posted to the death camps. In alternating chapters, the story is perfectly rendered in Malrich's wonderfully adolescent voice and Rachel's increasingly agonized diary entries. All this plays out against Malrich's perceptive likening of Hitler's Germany to the rise of fundamentalist Islamism on his housing estate and his realization that he must take action against the Nazi jihadist fuckers. An absorbing and all too relevant novel for our times. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There, in a cave hidden high above the ocean, they discover a fabulous creature: a glittering three-headed dragon with a kind heart, an unpredictable temper, and a memory that spans 20,000 years. Transported by the magic of the dragon's stories, the children meet Mei-lan, a young girl in ancient China who is called upon to save her village from great danger. They sail the seas in a 19-century ship with cabin boy Jamie Prichett. And, in more recent times, with Hitty and her brother Will, they survive a frightening plane crash on a desert island. In a novel as mysterious and spellbinding as the dragon's stories, Rebecca Rupp explore what three children from the present learn from the past&#x2014;and from an unlikely, but wise and generous friend.</p><p>Rebecca Rupp lives in Vermont with her husband and three sons, three cats, and a large garden full of heirloom tomatoes. Of THE DRAGON OF LONELY ISLAND, she says, &#34;We once had an invisible pet dragon named Petunia, plus did an awful lot of childhood reading.&#34;They strode along, single file because the old path was so narrow. Sarah Emily hummed as she walked. Zachary paused every once in a while to check directions on his compass. Hannah dabbed sunscreen on her nose. Soon Zachary and Sarah Emily were hungry again-"I can't believe you two, after eating all those doughnuts," said Hannah-so they paused, just at the foot of the hill, for a sandwich (peanut butter and Mrs. Jones's homemade strawberry jam), a cookie, and a drink of lemonade. Zachary's freckles began to come out in the sun. Sarah Emily crumpled the last sandwich wrapper and tucked it back into Zachary's pack. "Let's go to the very top," she said, "and look for China."<br>"Wrong direction and wrong ocean," said Hannah. "Try France."<br>"Or Greenland," said Zachary. "Last one to the top is a rotten egg!" He grabbed the pack and began to run, bounding up the little path, winding in and out around scattered boulders. <br>Hannah and Sarah Emily-shouting "Hey!" and "Wait for me!"-dashed after him. <br>The hill was steeper than it looked. Soon the children were breathless, and one after another they slowed, panting, to a walk. They were hot, and the backs of Sarah Emily's legs began to ache. They staggered up the last few feet and collapsed, laughing, against the huge heap of piled rocks that formed the very peak of Drake's Hill. Zachary raised his fist in triumph. "Excelsior!" he shouted.<br>The view from the hill was spectacular. From their height, they could trace the coast of the island and gaze far out to sea. "I feel like I've just climbed Mount Everest," said Hannah. <br>"Let's get right up on top of these rocks," said Zachary. "Then we'll be able to see everything in both directions."<br>They scrambled up the side of the great heap of gray boulders, scrabbling for footholds as they climbed. The rocks were piled like giant jumbled steps. There were short heaving climbs-Sarah Emily, whose legs were short, needed to be boosted by Zachary and Hannah-then expanses of level flatness, then more steep climbs. At the last flat step, as they approached the peak, they came to a smooth, sheer wall, higher than Hannah's head, with not so much as a crack or a crevice in sight. "Let's go back," said Sarah Emily. "It's too high."<br>But Zachary refused to give up.<br>"Maybe we can get up from the other side," he said.<br>The step-more like a rocky shelf-curved around to the right, almost like a walkway circling the very top of the hill. The children cautiously edged their way around it. Sarah Emily, who hated heights, refused to look down. On the north side of the rock face, the shelf suddenly widened out into a broad platform, high above and overlooking the empty sea.<br>"Look at that!" gasped Sarah Emily.<br>"A cave!" said Zachary. <br>At the back of the stone platform, a wide gaping opening led back into darkness.<br>"Let's go inside," said Zachary eagerly, but Sarah Emily hung back. <br>"Let's not," she said. "There could be anything in there. Bears or something. And besides, it smells funny."<br>Zachary and Hannah sniffed the air. Near the cave entrance, there was a strange odor: the smell of charcoal and smoke, with a hint of something tangier, spicy, alien. <br>"Probably just old campfires," said Zachary. "Maybe Mr. and Mrs. Jones used to come up here and roast marshmallows." He peered blindly into the darkness, then turned to fumble in his backpack. "Just a minute," he said. "I brought my flashlight."<br>He switched it on and cautiously stepped forward into the cave. Sarah Emily and Hannah crowded behind him. The three children, clinging to each other, edged slowly inward. As they moved into the cave, the sound of the sea abruptly shut off, as though someone had thrown a massive switch. The cave floor seemed to slant downward into the hill, and inside, it felt enormous; there was a sense of soaring sub-<br>terranean spaces. Zachary's flashlight barely penetrated the gloom. "It didn't look this big from the outside," Sarah Emily whispered. Groping, they stretched out their arms, left and right, to the sides.<br>"Can anybody feel a wall anywhere?" Zachary asked softly. Nobody could.<br>"This place is simply huge," said Hannah. "The whole inside of the hill must be hollow."<br>"It feels endless," said Sarah Emily nervously.<br>The children shuffled forward, feeling gingerly with their feet. "There could be deep holes," said Sarah Emily. The strange sharp smell-smoke? sulfur?-got stronger.<br>"You know what I wonder?" said Zachary. "Where did this hill get its name anyway? Was the sea captain who built the house named Drake? How come it's called Drake's Hill?"<br>There was a sudden shifting sound from the back of the cave, a heavy sandpapery scraping noise. Then there came a soft hiss in the darkness-the sound of a lighted blowtorch, thought Zachary-and a red-and-yellow flare of flame. The interior of the cave leaped into light. Before the children's astonished eyes, a vast expanse of gold flashed and glittered. There before them lay a long reptilian body, curled comfortably on the cave floor, with a coiled golden tail, ending in a flat arrowhead-shaped point. Two eyes-sharp slits of jade green-glared at them out of the darkness.<br>"It is called Drake's Hill, young man," said a deep, raspy voice, "because drake is an ancient and honorable name for dragon. The hill is named after me."<br><br>THE DRAGON OF LONELY ISLAND by Rebecca Rupp. Copyright (c) 1998 by Rebecca Rupp. Published by Candlewick Press, Inc., Cambridge, MA.</p><h2>The Shadow</h2><p>Criminal mastermind-turned-crime fighter Lamont Cranston uses his uncanny psychic powers and his disguise as the enigmatic Shadow to battle crime in 1930s New York and faces his ultimate challenge in the powerful and evil Shiwan Khan</p><p></p><h2>Finder: Voice</h2><p><i>What you find isn't nearly as important as what finds you . . .<br> <br></i> Since 1996, <i>Finder</i> has set the bar for science-fiction storytelling, with a lush, intricate world and compelling characters.

By means of letters, diaries, visitors books, menus, accounts and many other first-hand reports, the author has captured the spirit of the castle and its shifting household. It investigates the family&#39;s political and artistic achievements. In its heyday the estate was a great liberal centre. The family was consistently involved at the forefront of European art and was the focal point of the pre-Raphaelite movement. The strange reverse of this leads the story to the present day - a kind of passionate puritanism which lead to violent rebellion in the younger generation and the break up of the Howard estates and fortunes. This book is a social history which goes behind the scenes to describe the daily lives of the Earls of Carlisle and their guests, and the events which occupied them.</p><p></p><h2>The Friendship of Christ (Thomas More Books to Live Series)</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

He lives in New York.Introduction<br><br>As editor and introducer of The Best American Mystery Stories 2004, I bid you welcome.<br><br>You needn&#x2019;t read any further, but may now go directly to the stories.<br>Still here? Well, then, I won&#x2019;t take much of your time.<br><br>In the beginning was Otto Penzler, a legend in the &#xfb01;eld of mystery publishing, and a very persuasive gentleman. When Mr.<br>Penzler asked me to be the editor of this anthology, I explained that I wasn&#x2019;t quali&#xfb01;ed to take on the task. He agreed, but in turn explained to me that his &#xfb01;rst and second choices had dropped out at the last minute, and I apparently owed him a favor.<br><br>Like many of my generation, I grew up on mystery short stories, devouring anthologies and collections as well as mystery magazines.<br><br>My favorite mystery stories, and probably everyone&#x2019;s favorites, were Edgar Allan Poe, and Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes mysteries.<br>The short story is a deceptively simple format, and the mystery shorts seem even simpler, until you try to write one.<br><br>Two of the &#xfb01;rst things I ever had published were mystery stories: one titled &#x201c;Life or Breath,&#x201d; in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine; the other called &#x201c;The Mystery at Thorn Mansion,&#x201d; in the now-defunct Mystery Monthly.<br><br>I also have a &#xfb01;le of rejection letters and enough unpublished short stories to kindle wet logs.<br><br>It became obvious to me that short stories are not easy to write just because they are short. Which takes me back to my high school days, when I was a sprinter on the track team. Anyone can run a hundred-yard dash, but the difference between doing it in 11 seconds or 10.2 seconds is the difference between last place and &#xfb01;rst place.<br><br>Obviously, when it came to writing, I wasn&#x2019;t a sprinter, so I tried out for the long-distance team and became a novelist, which I found to be a lot easier.<br><br>The moral, if there is a moral, is that the short story, like the short race, needs to be close to perfect; there is no recovery from a bad start, no time to get a second wind, and no forgiveness for even one misstep.<br><br>And so, I am honored to have been chosen to pick the top twenty stories for this anthology, and to join a long and illustrious list of past editors whom I will mention here in the hope that future editors will mention me: Robert B. Parker, Sue Grafton, Ed McBain, Donald E. Westlake, Lawrence Block, James Ellroy, and Michael Connelly.<br><br>Those authors are themselves the best of the best, but I&#x2019;m sure that they, like me, have trouble judging the works of others.<br>I am currently one of four judges for the Book-of-the-Month Club, along with Annie Proulx, Bill Bryson, and Anna Quindlen, and I can tell you that most authors would rather not be judges of other authors &#x2014; I&#x2019;d rather be a wine judge, or (ecstasy!) a beauty pageant judge.<br><br>So, when Otto Penzler asked me to pick the best twenty mystery stories from more than &#xfb01;fty entries, I was not being coy or humble when I said I was not quali&#xfb01;ed; I am actually quali&#xfb01;ed, I just don&#x2019;t like to read with the knowledge that I&#x2019;ve got to winnow and toss.<br>Newsday once asked me &#x2014; and Susan Isaacs and Roger Rosenblatt &#x2014; to judge essays and &#xfb01;ction pieces sent in by hundreds of readers on the topic of Long Island history. We had to pick one non&#xfb01;ction and one &#xfb01;ction piece, and I can tell you, these were among the worst pieces of writing any of us had ever read. Thankfully, there were two or three pieces in each category that were good, so picking the winners was not that dif&#xfb01;cult.<br>But here we have a different situation; without exception all &#xfb01;fty mystery stories that I read were very good to excellent, and the difference in quality was like the difference between the 11-second hundred-yard dash &#x2014; very impressive &#x2014; and the 10.2-second hundred- yard dash &#x2014; exceptional.<br><br>I had great fun reading, but not so much fun picking. In fact, it was agonizing, and I suggested to Otto Penzler a bigger, fatter book of, say, &#xfb01;fty of the Best American Mystery Stories.<br><br>&#x201c;Not possible,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It would look like your last bloated novel.&#x201d;<br><br>So, I went back to the stories, this time using a single criterion: Did I really want to reread this story?<br><br>Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes stories are probably the only things I&#x2019;ve read six, eight, or ten times each. I can pick up a collection of Sherlock Holmes anytime, anyplace, open at random, and enjoy the story as much as or even more than when I &#xfb01;rst read it.<br>So, for better or worse, without too much further agonizing, I have picked what I hope you agree are the Best American Mystery Stories for the 2004 edition.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br>AAnd try to pick the best &#xfb01;ve.<br><br>Nelson De Mille<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Houghton Mifflin.

Jewish musical prodigy Lisa Jura has a wonderful life in Vienna. But when the Nazis start closing in on the city, life changes irreversibly. Although he has three daughters, Lisa&#39;s father is only able to secure one berth on the Kindertransport. The family decides to send Lisa to London so that she may pursue her dreams of a career as a concert pianist. Separated from her beloved family, Lisa bravely endures the trip and a disastrous posting outside London before finding her way to the Willesden Lane Orphanage.It is in this orphanage that Lisa&#39;s story truly comes to life. Her music inspires the other orphanage children, and they, in turn, cheer her on in her efforts to make good on her promise to her family to realize her musical potential. Through hard work and sheer pluck, Lisa wins a scholarship to study piano at the Royal Academy. As she supports herself and studies, she makes a new life for herself and dreams of reconnecting with the family she was forced to leave behind. The resulting tale delivers a message of the power of music to uplift the human spirit and to grant the individual soul endurance, patience, and peace.</p><p>A prolific recording artist and producer, Mona Golabek has appeared with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the National Symphony, and the Tokyo Philharmonic. She has performed at the Kennedy Center, the Hollywood Bowl, and London's Royal Festival Hall. Golabek lives in Los Angeles, California. <p>Lee Cohen is a journalist, screenwriter and poet. He co-produced and wrote the feature film The Effects of Magic and has collaborated with Mona Golabek on several projects, including a recording of Ravel's Mother Goose Suite featuring Meryl Streep. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and son.</p>One of 10,000 Jewish children sent to England by fearful parents at the dawn of WWII, aspiring pianist Lisa Jura was 14 when her family put her on a Kindertransport train in Vienna. In this alternately heart-wrenching and uplifting story, Jura's daughter, Golabek, a pianist, and writer Cohen trace the six years Jura spent in London, where she found surrogate families in the 31 other young refugees at the Willesden Lane hostel, and in the working-class British women at the East End garment factory that employed her. The authors beautifully capture Jura's passion for music and her determination to realize her dream of becoming a concert pianist. Her quest to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music seems to inject hope into everyone with whom she comes into contact: the hostel owner provides her with a piano and practice time, her housemates band together to drill her on technique and theory, and a co-worker makes her an audition outfit. Yet this is no Babes in Arms. Jura's struggle to hold herself together on the trip to England and as she makes a life for herself without the guidance of her beloved mother is as bleak as her musical successes are joyful. And the depictions of V-Day are especially vivid: rather than celebrate with the masses, Jura retreats to the hostel. The war may be over, but for her and her fellow young refugees waiting to learn the fate of their families, the tragedy will continue. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ana Kai Tangata: Tales of the Outer the Other the Damned and the Doomed</h2><p>Debut collection of Weird Horror fiction by Scott Nicolay.

For fifteen years, Nap has been searching, both for Maura and for the real reason behind his brother's death. And now, it looks as though he may finally find what he's been looking for.&nbsp;<br><br> When Maura's fingerprints turn up in the rental car of a suspected murderer, Nap embarks on a quest for answers that only leads to more questions&#x2014;about the woman he loved, about the childhood friends he thought he knew, about the abandoned military base near where he grew up, and mostly about Leo and Diana&#x2014;whose deaths are darker and far more sinister than Nap ever dared imagine.</p><p>With more than seventy million books in print worldwide, <b>Harlan Coben</b>&nbsp;is the internationally bestselling author of thirty novels, including the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Home</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fool Me Once</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Stranger</i>,&nbsp;<i>Missing You</i>,&nbsp;<i>Six Years</i>,&nbsp;<i>Stay Close</i>,&nbsp;<i>Live Wire</i>,&nbsp;<i>Caught</i>,&nbsp;<i>Long Lost</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Hold Tight</i>, as well as the Myron Bolitar series and a series aimed at young adults featuring Myron's nephew, Mickey Bolitar.&nbsp;His books are published in forty-three languages around the globe and have been number one bestsellers in more than a dozen countries. The winner of the Edgar, Shamus, and Anthony Awards, he lives in New Jersey.Daisy wore a clingy black dress with a neckline so deep it could tutor philosophy.<br><br> She spotted the mark sitting at the end of the bar, wearing a gray pinstripe suit. Hmm. The guy was old enough to be her dad. That might make it more difficult to make her play, but then again, it might not. You never knew with the old guys. Some of them, especially the recent divorcees, are all too ready to preen and prove they still got it, even if they never had it in the first place.<br><br> <i>Especially </i>if they never had it in the first place.<br><br> As Daisy sauntered across the room, she could feel the eyes of the male patrons crawling down her bare legs like earthworms. When she reached the end of the bar, she made a mild production of lowering herself onto the stool next to him.<br><br> The mark peered into the glass of whiskey in front of him as though he were a gypsy with a crystal ball. She waited for him to turn toward her. He didn&#x2019;t. Daisy studied his profile for a moment. His beard was heavy and gray. His nose was bulbous and putty-like, almost as though it were a Hollywood silicon special effect. His hair was long, straggly, mop-like.<br><br> Second marriage, Daisy figured. Second divorce in all probability.<br><br> Dale Miller&#x2014;that was the mark&#x2019;s name&#x2014;picked up his whiskey gently and cradled it in both hands like it was an injured bird.<br><br> &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; Daisy said with a much-practiced hair toss.<br><br> Miller&#x2019;s eyes slid toward her. He looked her straight in the eyes. She waited for his gaze to dip down to the neckline&#x2014;heck, even women did it with this dress&#x2014;but they stayed on hers.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; he replied. Then he turned back to his whiskey.<br><br> Daisy usually let the mark hit on her. That was her go-to technique. She said hi like this, she smiled, the guy asked whether he could buy her a drink. You know the deal. But Miller didn&#x2019;t look in the mood to flirt. He took a deep swallow from his whiskey glass, then another.<br><br> That was good. The heavy drinking. That would make this easier.<br><br> &#x201c;Is there something I can do for you?&#x201d; he asked her.<br><br> Burly, Daisy thought. That was the word to describe him. Even in that pinstripe suit, Miller had that burly-biker-Vietnam-vet thing going on, his voice a low rasp. He was the kind of older guy Daisy found sexy, though that was probably her now legendary daddy issues rearing their insecure head. Daisy liked men who made her feel safe.<br><br> It had been too long since she&#x2019;d known one.<br><br> Time to try another angle, Daisy thought.<br><br> &#x201c;Do you mind if I just sit here with you?&#x201d; Daisy leaned a little closer, working the cleavage a bit, and whispered, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s this guy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is he bothering you?&#x201d;<br><br> Sweet. He didn&#x2019;t say it all macho poseur like so many d-bags she had met along the way. Dale Miller said it calmly, matter-of-factly, chivalrously, even&#x2014;like a man who wanted to protect her.<br><br> &#x201c;No, no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not really.&#x201d;<br><br> He started looking around the bar. &#x201c;Which one is he?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy put a hand on his arm.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a big deal. Really. I just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel safe here with you, okay?&#x201d;<br><br> Miller met her eyes again. The bulbous nose didn&#x2019;t go with the face, but you almost didn&#x2019;t notice it with those piercing blue eyes. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said, but in a cautious voice. &#x201c;Can I buy you a drink?&#x201d;<br><br> That was pretty much all the opening Daisy needed. She was good with conversation, and men&#x2014;married, single, getting divorced, whatever&#x2014;never minded opening up to her. It took Dale Miller a little more time than usual&#x2014;Drink Four, if her count was correct&#x2014;but eventually he got to the impending divorce to Clara, his, yup, second wife who was eighteen years his junior. (&#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve know, right? I&#x2019;m such a fool.&#x201d;) A drink later, he told her about the two kids Ryan and Simone, the custody battle, his job in finance.<br><br> She had to open up, too. That was how this worked. Prime the pump. She had a story at the ready for just such occasions&#x2014;a completely fictional one, of course&#x2014;but something about the way Miller carried himself made her add shades of candor. She would never tell him the truth. No one knew that in this town, except Rex. And even Rex didn&#x2019;t know it all.<br><br> He drank whiskey. She drank vodka. She tried to imbibe at a slower pace. Twice she took her full glass to the bathroom, dumped it into the sink, filled it with water. Still, Daisy was feeling a little buzzed when the text came in from Rex.<br><br> R?<br><br> R for Ready.<br><br> &#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d; Miller asked her.<br><br> &#x201c;Sure. Just a friend.&#x201d;<br><br> She texted back a Y for Yes and turned back to him. This was the part where she would normally suggest that they go someplace quieter. Most men jumped at the chance&#x2014;men were nothing if not predicable on that score&#x2014;but she wasn&#x2019;t sure that direct route would work with Dale Miller. It wasn&#x2019;t that he didn&#x2019;t seem interested. He just seemed to be somehow&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t sure how to put it&#x2014;somehow above it.<br><br> &#x201c;Could I ask you something?&#x201d; she began.<br><br> Miller smiled. &#x201c;You been asking me things all night.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a slight slur in his voice. Good.<br><br> &#x201c;Do you have a car?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I do. Why?&#x201d;<br><br> She glanced about the bar. &#x201c;Could I, uh, ask you for a ride home? I don&#x2019;t live far.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure, no problem.&#x201d; Then: &#x201c;I may need a little time to sober up&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy hopped off the stool. &#x201c;Oh that&#x2019;s okay. I&#x2019;ll walk then.&#x201d;<br><br> Miller sat upright. &#x201c;Wait, what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I kinda need to get home now, but if you can&#x2019;t drive&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; he said, managing to stand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> He hopped off the stool. &#x201c;No trouble, Daisy.&#x201d;<br><br> Bingo. As they started for the door, Daisy quickly texted Rex:<br><br> OOW<br><br> Code for On Our Way.<br><br> Some might call it a con or swindle, but Rex insisted that it was &#x201c;righteous&#x201d; money. Daisy wasn&#x2019;t sure about righteous, but she didn&#x2019;t feel a lot of guilt about it either. The plan was simple in execution, if not motive. A man and a woman are getting divorced. The custody battle turns nasty. Both sides get desperate. The wife&#x2014;technically speaking, the husband could use their services, too, though so far it had always been the wife&#x2014;hired Rex to help them win this bloodiest of battles. How did he do it?<br><br> Nail the husband on a DUI.<br><br> What better way to show the man is an unfit parent?<br><br> So that was how it worked. Daisy&#x2019;s job was twofold: Make sure the mark was legally drunk and then get him behind the wheel. Rex, who was a cop, pulled the guy over, arrested him for driving under the influence, and boom, their client gets a big boost in the court proceedings. Right now, Rex was waiting in a squad car two blocks away. He always found an abandoned spot very close to whatever bar the mark would be drinking in that evening. The fewer witnesses, the better. They didn&#x2019;t want questions.<br><br> Pull the guy over, arrest him, move on.<br><br> They both stumbled out the door and into the lot.<br><br> &#x201c;This way,&#x201d; Miller said. &#x201c;I parked over here.&#x201d;<br><br> The lot was made up of loose pebbles. Miller kicked them up as he led her to a gray Toyota Corolla. He hit the key fob. The car gave a muted double honk. When Miller headed toward the passenger door, Daisy was confused. Did he want her to drive? God, she hoped not. Was he more wasted than she thought? That seemed more likely. But she quickly realized it was neither of those things.<br><br> Dale Miller was opening the door for her. Like a real gentleman. That was how long it had been since Daisy had known a real gentleman. She hadn&#x2019;t even realized what he was doing.<br><br> He held the door and waited. Daisy slid into the car. Dale Miller waited while she was all the way in and properly situated before he carefully closed the door behind her.<br><br> She felt a pang of guilt.<br><br> Rex had pointed out many times that they weren&#x2019;t doing anything illegal or even ethically dubious. For one thing, the plan didn&#x2019;t always work. Some guys don&#x2019;t hang out in bars. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201d; Rex had told her, &#x201c;then he&#x2019;s in the clear. Our guy is already out drinking, right? You&#x2019;re just giving him a little push, that&#x2019;s all. But he doesn&#x2019;t have to drink and drive. That&#x2019;s his choice in the end. You&#x2019;re not putting a gun to his head.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy put on her seat belt. Dale Miller did the same. He started the car and put it in reverse. The tires crunched the pebbles. When he was clear of the spot, Miller stopped the car and looked at Daisy for a long moment. She tried to smile, but it wouldn&#x2019;t hold.<br><br> &#x201c;What are you hiding, Daisy?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> She felt a chill but didn&#x2019;t reply.<br><br> &#x201c;Something happened to you. I can see it in your face.&#x201d;<br><br> Not sure what else to do, Daisy tried to laugh it off. &#x201c;I told you my life story in that bar, Dale.&#x201d;<br> Miller waited another second, maybe two, though it felt to her like an hour. Finally, he looked forward and put the car in drive. He didn&#x2019;t say another word as they made their way out of the parking lot.<br><br> &#x201c;Take a left,&#x201d; Daisy said, hearing the tenseness in her own voice. &#x201c;And then it&#x2019;s the second right.&#x201d;<br><br> Dale Miller was silent now, making the turns deliberately, the way you do when you&#x2019;ve had too much to drink but don&#x2019;t want to get pulled over. The Toyota Corolla was clean and impersonal and smelled a little too strongly of deodorizer. When Miller took the second right, Daisy held her breath and waited for Rex&#x2019;s blue lights and siren to come on.<br><br> This was always the scary part for Daisy, because you never knew how someone was going to react. One guy tried to make a run for it, though he realized the futility before he reached the next corner. Some guys started cursing. Some guys&#x2014;too many of them&#x2014;started sobbing. That was the worst. Grown men, coolly hitting on her moments ago, some still with their hand sliding up past her dress, suddenly starting blubbering like preschoolers.<br><br> They realized the severity in an instant. That realization crushed them.<br><br> Daisy didn&#x2019;t know what to expect with Dale Miller.<br><br> Rex had the timing down to a science, and as though on cue, the spinning blue light came to life, followed immediately by the squad-car siren. Daisy pivoted and studied Dale Miller&#x2019;s face to gauge his reaction. If Miller seemed distraught or surprised, neither emotion was showing on his face. He was composed, determined, even. He used his blinker to signal before carefully veering to a proper stop by the curb as Rex pulled up behind him.<br><br> The siren was off now, the blue light still circling.<br><br> Dale Miller put the car in park and turned to her. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what expression to go with here. Surprise? Sympathy? A what-can-you-do sigh?<br><br> &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; Miller said. &#x201c;It looks like the past has caught up with us, eh?&#x201d;<br><br> His words, his tone, his expression, unnerved her. She wanted to yell for Rex to hurry, but he was taking his time the way a cop does. Dale Miller kept his eyes on her, even after Rex did a knuckle-knock on his window. Miller slowly turned away and slid open the window.<br><br> &#x201c;Is there a problem, officer?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;License and registration, please.&#x201d;<br><br> Dale Miller handed them over.<br><br> &#x201c;Have you been drinking tonight?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe one,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> With that answer, at least, he was the same as every other mark. They always lied.<br><br> &#x201c;Do you mind stepping out of the car for a moment?&#x201d;<br><br> Miller turned back toward Daisy. Daisy tried not to cringe under his gaze. She stared straight ahead, avoiding eye contact.<br><br> Rex said, &#x201c;Sir? I asked you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course, officer.&#x201d;<br><br> Dale Miller pulled the handle. When the interior car light came, Daisy closed her eyes for a moment. Miller rolled out with a grunt. He left the door open, but Rex reached past him and slammed it closed. The window was still open so Daisy could hear.<br><br> &#x201c;Sir, I would like to run a series of field sobriety tests on you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We could skip that,&#x201d; Dale Miller said.<br><br> &#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go right to the Breathalyzer, if that would be easier?&#x201d;<br><br> That offer surprised Rex. He glanced past Miller for a moment and caught her eye. Daisy gave a small shrug.<br><br> &#x201c;I assume you have a field Breathalyzer in your squad car?&#x201d; Miller asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I do, yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So let&#x2019;s not waste your time or mine or the lovely lady&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br> Rex hesitated. Then he said, &#x201c;Okay, please wait here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br> When Rex turned to go back to his squad car, Dale Miller pulled out a gun and shot Rex twice in the back of the head. Rex crumpled to the ground.<br><br> Then Dale Miller turned the gun toward Daisy.<br><br> They&#x2019;re back, she thought.<br><br> After all these years, they found me.</p><h2>200 Tips for Jewelry Making: Tips,Techniques and Trade Secrets</h2><p><p> <b><i>An indispensable compendium of essential knowledge and troubleshooting tips. </i></b> </p><p> This book packs in the combined wisdom of two successful jewelry-makers who are consummate problem solvers.

In <i>South Korea at the Crossroads</i>, Scott A. Snyder examines the trajectory of fifty years of South Korean foreign policy and offers predictions&#x2015;and a prescription&#x2015;for the future. Pairing a historical perspective with a shrewd understanding of today&#x2019;s political landscape, Snyder contends that South Korea&#x2019;s best strategy remains investing in a robust alliance with the United States.<br><br>Snyder begins with South Korea&#x2019;s effort in the 1960s to offset the risk of abandonment by the United States during the Vietnam War and the subsequent crisis in the alliance during the 1970s. A series of shifts in South Korean foreign relations followed: the &#x201c;Nordpolitik&#x201d; engagement with the Soviet Union and China at the end of the Cold War; Kim Dae Jung&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sunshine Policy,&#x201d; designed to bring North Korea into the international community; &#x201c;trustpolitik,&#x201d; which sought to foster diplomacy with North Korea and Japan; and changes in South Korea&#x2019;s relationship with the United States. Despite its rise as a leader in international financial, development, and climate-change forums, South Korea will likely still require the commitment of the United States to guarantee its security. Although China is a tempting option, Snyder argues that only the United States is both credible and capable in this role. South Korea remains vulnerable relative to other regional powers in northeast Asia despite its rising profile as a middle power, and it must balance the contradiction of desirable autonomy and necessary alliance.</p><p>Scott A. Snyder is senior fellow for Korea studies and director of the program on Korea-U.S. policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Books)</h2><p>Here, children can listen to the story of the Creation and participate in the fun by answering questions, pointing and making sounds.</p><p></p><h2>Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare Experiences</h2><p><p> Why pause and study this particular painting among so many others ranged on a gallery wall? Wonder, which Descartes called the first of the passions, is at play; it couples surprise with a wish to know more, the pleasurable promise that what is novel or rare may become familiar. This is a book about the aesthetics of wonder, about wonder as it figures in our relation to the visual world and to rare or new experiences. </p><p> In three instructive instances--a pair of paintings by Cy Twombly, the famous problem of doubling the area of a square, and the history of attempts to explain rainbows--Philip Fisher examines the experience of wonder as it draws together pleasure, thinking, and the aesthetic features of thought. Through these examples he places wonder in relation to the ordinary and the everyday as well as to its opposite, fear. The remarkable story of how rainbows came to be explained, fraught with errors, half-knowledge, and incomplete understanding, suggests that certain knowledge cannot be what we expect when wonder engages us. Instead, Fisher argues, a detailed familiarity, similar to knowing our way around a building or a painting, is the ultimate meeting point for aesthetic and scientific encounters with novelty, rare experiences, and the genuinely new. </p></p><p><b>Philip Fisher</b> is the Felice Crowl Reid Professor of English and American Literature at Harvard University.A short but ample book, in which Fisher ranges well beyond his home territory of literature into science, mathematics, philosophy, architecture, mythology, and modern art and where Shakespeare rubs shoulders with Frank Lloyd Wright, Nabokov with Aristotle, Newton with Cy Twombly. Fisher takes wonder where he finds it, in the Chicago skyline, Miranda's exclamations in <i>The Tempest</i> or Descartes's explanation of the rainbow. Experiences of wonder may be by definition rare, but for Fisher they are dispersed all over the map of knowledge...This is a learned, cultivated work. (Lorraine Daston <i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Like Kant, Fisher wants to sketch out 'the lively border' between aesthetics and intelligibility, and he is to be applauded for pursuing this border in and of itself, without reducing aesthetic experience to ideology, sociology, or identity politics, as the greater part of university literary criticism has tended to do over the past decade. Unlike Kant, Fisher employs an eclectic discursive method, passing with admirable erudition from Descarte's account of the rainbow to Plato's geometrical problem of how to double the area of a square to an analysis of two abstract canvases by Cy Twombly. (Adam Bresnick <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>In <i>Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare Experiences</i>, Philip Fisher confronts one of our most fundamental cliches about the modern era: that science, by explaining the mechanics of the physical world, has demystified our world. We now know how tornadoes and rainbows work, how suns and planets are made, and how a caterpillar becomes a butterfly. Has this knowledge brought a loss of innocence?...Fisher argues the opposite...In this delightful history of attempts to understand the rainbow, Fisher shows that wonder and science walk hand in hand...<i>Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare Experiences</i> is an excellent exercise in stretching the mind, and it is full of extraordinary insights. With his study, Fisher has emulated the actors in the grand story of human learning--the pioneers who went after the wonderful, and in so doing, gave us more. (David Grayson <i>San Francisco Bay Guardian</i>)<br><br>An impressive literary-philosophical-geometric thesis that argues for the primacy of the feeling of wonder on confronting rare beauty in art or in nature. (<i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>Philip Fisher's new book not only is about wonder, but is in itself a wondrous performance-fresh, provocative, original, and sure to provoke lively debate in the fields of aesthetics and epistemology' (W. J. I. Mitchell, author of Picture Theory)<br><br>At a time when so much writing in the theory of art and the criticism of culture can seem to sublime itself without managing to become interesting, Philip Fisher has produced an aesthetics of wonder that provides the freshness of experience he undertakes to explain. (Stanley Cavell, author of A Pitch of Philosophy)<br><br>Philip Fisher's book on wonder is a brilliant, original, and wide-ranging study of a subject that has only recently become visible to intellectual historians. It is also, like all Fisher's work, marvelously lucid and richly suggestive (Michael Fried, author of Manet's Modernism)</p><h2>The Vendetta: Special Agent Melvin Purvis, John Dillinger, and Hoover&#39;s FBI in the Age of Gangsters</h2><p>In <i>The Vendetta</i>, author Alston Purvis recounts the story of his father, Melvin Purvis, the iconic G-man and public hero made famous by his remarkable sweep of the great Public Enemies of the American Depression&#x2014;John Dillinger; Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson. Purvis&#x2019;s successes led FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover to grow increasingly jealous, to the point where he vowed to bring down Purvis. Hoover smeared Purvis&#x2019;s reputation, and tried to erase his name from all records of the FBI's greatest triumphs. This book sets the record straight, and provides a grippingly authentic new telling of the gangster era, seen from the perspective of the pursuers.</p><p>Alston Purvis has appeared widely in the US media, including the History Channel, to talk about his father. He is head of Boston University&#39;s design department. Alex Tresniowski is a senior writer for People magazine specializing in politics, crime and current events. The author of five books, including an upcoming biography of boxer Billy Conn, he lives in New Jersey.Purvis's fascinating story of his father, once internationally famous for his role in the violent takedown of John Dillinger and now an obscure figure, limns a true American tragedy. The senior Purvis's meteoric rise to prominence at the FBI, just coming into its own, placed the genteel lawyer at the center of the war on crime that gripped the nation in the early 1930s. His enthusiasm and dedication caught the notice of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who promoted him repeatedly and gave him more and more serious responsibilities. But Hoover's pettiness and paranoia led him to turn on his prot�g�, even reaching out decades after Purvis's departure from the Bureau to block him from other jobs. The book's impact is lessened somewhat by florid writing ("Something evil came to Wellsville in the dead of night"). Purvis (with <i>People </i>magazine writer Tresniowski) could have compensated for the existence of rival narratives such as Bryan Burrough's definitive <i>Public Enemies</i> by dwelling more on his own memories of his father, rather than giving details of manhunts for gangsters, but he succeeds in giving Melvin Purvis the accolades he deserves.

As an adult she finds a new haven: the boundless, blank iciness of Antarctica where everything "is colored white and filled with a singing silence."</p><p>This blistering account interweaves the story of the author's journey to the end of the earth, her daughter's search for Diski's missing mother, and Diski's own search of her memory-hardened heart.</p></p><p>"I am not entirely content with the degree of whiteness in my life. My bedroom is white: white walls, icy mirrors, white sheets and pillowcases, white slatted blinds. It's the best I could do." <p> Jenny Diski's obsession with the cool purity of white began early in life, when as a small child, she was taken for weekly skating lessons at the local ice rink. Between practicing figure eights, she would watch the Zamboni move across the ice scraping away the pitted, blade-scored surface: "It was all taken away in minutes and underneath was pure, untouched surface again, gleaming milky white, virgin, immaculate ice." This gleaming, immaculate ice stands in stark contrast to Diski's dark and emotionally fraught home life with two abusive parents. <i>Skating to Antarctica</i> is an unusual blend of travel essay and personal memoir, one that uses the phases of a physical journey to trace the trajectory of the inner life. Both journeys begin for Diski when her 18-year-old daughter Chloe decides to search for the maternal grandmother she has never met. It has been 30 years since Diski last saw her mother, and she has no desire to find her; is it merely coincidence that she books her passage to Antarctica shortly after Chloe begins the hunt?</p><p> Weaving painful memories of a childhood spent entangled in her parents' vicious sexual psychodramas and an adolescence in and out of mental wards into an account of her slow journey south, Diski imbues both voyages of discovery with a resonance that comes largely from twinning these tales. Like all polar travelers, she has the experiences of Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton before her; instinctively she rejects the "heroism" of Scott's pointless death in a blizzard, embracing, instead Shackleton's pragmatic rescue of his stranded crew. "The will to live was not strong in my family," Diski writes near the end of her book; <i>Skating to Antarctica</i>, however, is proof that <i>this</i> apple at least fell far, far from the tree.</p><p>Jenny Diski has written seven novels, a volume of short stories, and a collection of essays. She lives in London.</p></p><h2>The Secret War Against Hitler</h2><p>In his final written testament, the late CIA director chronicles the role played by U.S. intelligence services in World War II and shows how intelligence is used and misused by our government today</p><p>WILLIAM JOSEPH CASEY (1913-1987) was the Director of Central Intelligence from 1981 to 1987. In this capacity he oversaw the entire United States Intelligence Community and personally directed the Central Intelligence Agency.During World War II, Casey, the late CIA director, was a staff officer in the Office of Strategic Services' London branch, in charge of sending agents behind enemy lines. The most interesting passages in this bland account describe the difficulty of getting the high command to pay attention to information gathered by those agents. Casey regrets that the OSS, forerunner of the CIA, was unable to exploit the political advantages of the failed putsch against Hitler on July 20, 1944; he also bemoans the tardy penetration of Germany by OSS agents. In his opinion, the OSS "should have and could have" exploded the myth of the Bavarian redoubt, the Alpine retreat from which Hitler supposedly expected to fight on indefinitely. Casey's summary of OSS activities from 1943 to the end of the war in Europe is disappointingly reticent. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and Its Implications (The Nature of Human Society Series)</h2><p>Louis Dumont's modern classic, here presented in an enlarged, revised, and corrected second edition, simultaneously supplies that reader with the most cogent statement on the Indian caste system and its organizing principles and a provocative advance in the comparison of societies on the basis of their underlying ideologies.

She details the evolution of mosaics from their first manifestations around 3000 B.C.E. in Mesopotamia to the present; chronicles the breathtaking mosaics of Europe, Africa, and the Americas; and surveys the many materials used in their construction, from broken tiles to gold. The basic process has remained the same over the centuries, and King offers detailed how-to instructions in the second, and largest, portion of the book, providing specific information for the budding artisan on materials and tools, techniques, and designs. Project ideas take up the final third of this fresh and useful book, with five projects of varying difficulty derived from three geographical areas. Full of photographs both of finished mosaics and the steps required for their crafting, King's book will inform, instruct, and delight craft lovers. <i>Lauren Roberts</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As a vampire, he could easily trace away, disappearing. Instead, he raised his face to gaze at her with dark gray eyes, the color of a storm about to be unleashed. Surprisingly, they were clear of the red that marked a vampire&#x2019;s bloodlust, which meant he had never drunk a being to death. Yet.<br> <br>He beseeched with those eyes, and she realized he hungered for an end. He wanted the death blow she&#x2019;d come to his decrepit castle to deliver.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d stalked him soundlessly, primed for battle with a vicious predator. Kaderin had been in Scotland with other Valkyrie when they&#x2019;d received the call about a &#x201c;vampire haunting a castle and terrorizing a village in Russia.&#x201d; She had gladly volunteered to destroy the leech. She was her Valkyrie coven&#x2019;s most prolific killer, her life given over to ridding the earth of vampires.<br> <br>In Scotland, before this call to Russia, she&#x2019;d killed three.<br> <br>So why was she hesitating now? Why was she easing her sword back? He would be merely one among thousands of her kills, his fangs collected and strung together with the others she&#x2019;d taken.<br> <br>The last time she&#x2019;d stayed her hand had resulted in a tragedy so great her heart had been broken forever by it.<br> <br>In a deep, gravelly voice, the vampire asked, &#x201c;Why do you wait?&#x201d; He seemed startled by the sound of his own words.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why. Unfamiliar physical sensations wracked her. Her stomach knotted. As though a band had tightened around her chest, her lungs were desperate for breath. I can&#x2019;t comprehend why.<br> <br>The wind blew outside, sliding over the mountain, making this high room in the vampire&#x2019;s darkened lair groan. Unseen gaps in the walls allowed in the chill morning breeze. As he stood, rising to his full, towering height, her blade caught the wavering light from a cluster of candles and reflected it on him.<br> <br>His grave face was lean with harsh planes, and other females would consider it handsome. His black shirt was threadbare and unbuttoned, displaying much of his chest and sculpted torso, and his worn jeans were slung low at his narrow waist. The wind tugged at the tail of his shirt and stirred his thick black hair. Very handsome. But then, the vampires I kill often are.<br> <br>His gaze focused on the tip of her sword. Then, as if the threat of her weapon were forgotten, he studied her face, his eyes lingering on each of her features. His blatant appreciation unsettled her, and she clutched the hilt tightly, something she never did.<br> <br>Honed to masterly sharpness with her diamond file, her sword cut through bone and muscle with little effort. It swung perfectly from her loose wrist as though it were an extension of her arm. She&#x2019;d never needed to hold it tightly.<br> <br>Take his head. One less vampire. The species checked in the tiniest way.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; His speech was clipped like an aristocrat&#x2019;s, but held a familiar accent. Estonian. Though Estonia bordered Russia to the west and its inhabitants were considered a Nordic breed of Russian, she recognized the difference, and wondered what he was doing away from his own country.<br> <br>She tilted her head. &#x201c;Why do you want to know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would like to know the name of the woman who will deliver me from this.&#x201d;<br> <br>He wanted to die. After all she&#x2019;d suffered from his kind, the last thing she wanted to do was oblige the vampire in any way. &#x201c;You assume I&#x2019;ll deliver your death blow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you not?&#x201d; His lips curled at the corners, but it was a sad smile.<br> <br>Another tightening on the sword. She would. Of course, she would. Killing was her only purpose in life. She didn&#x2019;t care if his eyes weren&#x2019;t red. Ultimately, he would drink to kill, and he would turn.<br> <br>They always did.<br> <br>He stepped around a stack of hardbound books&#x2014;some of the hundreds of texts throughout the room with titles imprinted in Russian and, yes, Estonian&#x2014;and leaned his massive frame against the crumbling wall. He truly wasn&#x2019;t going to raise a hand in defense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before you do, speak again. Your voice is beautiful. As beautiful as your stunning face.&#x201d;<br> <br>She swallowed, startled to feel her cheeks heating. &#x201c;Who do you align with . . . ?&#x201d; She trailed off when he closed his eyes as though listening to her were bliss. &#x201c;The Forbearers?&#x201d;<br> <br>That got him to open his eyes. They were full of anger. &#x201c;I align with no one. Especially not them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you were once human, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; The Forbearers were an army, or order, of turned humans. They refused to take blood straight from the flesh because they believed that act caused bloodlust. By forbearing, they hoped to avoid becoming like crazed Horde vampires. The Valkyrie remained unoptimistic about their chances.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but I&#x2019;ve no interest in that order. And you? You&#x2019;re no human either, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She ignored his question. &#x201c;Why do you linger here in this castle?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;The villagers live in terror of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won this holding on the battlefield and rightly own it, so I stay. And I&#x2019;ve never harmed them.&#x201d; He turned away and murmured, &#x201c;I wish that I did not frighten them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaderin needed to get this killing over with. In just three days, she was to compete in the Talisman&#x2019;s Hie, which was basically a deadly, immortal version of The Amazing Race. Besides hunting vampires, the Hie was the only thing she lived for, and she needed to confirm transportation and secure supplies. And yet she found herself saying, &#x201c;They told me you live here alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>He faced her and gave a sharp nod. She sensed that he was embarrassed by this fact, as if he felt lacking that he didn&#x2019;t have a family here.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long?&#x201d;<br> <br>He hiked his broad shoulders, pretending nonchalance. &#x201c;A few centuries.&#x201d;<br> <br>To live solitary for all that time? &#x201c;The people in the valley sent for me,&#x201d; she said, as if she had to explain herself. The inhabitants of the remote village belonged to the Lore&#x2014;a population of immortals and &#x201c;mythical&#x201d; creatures kept secret from humans. Many of them still worshipped the Valkyrie and provided tributes, but that wasn&#x2019;t what made Kaderin travel to such an isolated place.<br> <br>The chance to kill even a single vampire had drawn her. &#x201c;They pleaded for me to destroy you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I await your leisure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not kill yourself, if that&#x2019;s what you want?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . complicated. But you save me from that end. I know you&#x2019;re a skilled warrior&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you know what I am?&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave a nod at her sword. &#x201c;I used to be a warrior, too, and your remarkable weapon speaks much.&#x201d;<br> <br>The one thing she felt pride in&#x2014;the one thing in her life that she had left and couldn&#x2019;t bear to lose&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d noted its excellence.<br> <br>He strode closer to her and lowered his voice. &#x201c;Strike your blow, creature. Know that no misfortune could come to you for killing one such as me. There is no reason to wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if this were a matter of conscience! It wasn&#x2019;t. It couldn&#x2019;t be. She had no conscience. No real feelings, no raw emotions. She was coldhearted. After the tragedy, she&#x2019;d prayed for oblivion, prayed for the sorrow and guilt to be numbed.<br> <br>Some mysterious entity had answered her and made her heart like ash. Kaderin didn&#x2019;t suffer from sorrow, from lust, from anger, or from joy. Nothing got in the way of her killing.<br> <br>She was a perfect killer. She had been for one thousand years, half of her interminable life.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d; he asked. The eyes that had been pleading for an end now narrowed. &#x201c;Are you alone?&#x201d;<br> <br>She quirked an eyebrow. &#x201c;I do not require help from others. Especially not for a single vampire,&#x201d; she added, her tone growing absent. Oddly, her attention had dipped to his body once more&#x2014;to low on his torso, past his navel to the dusky trail of hair leading down. She imagined grazing the back of one of her sharp claws along it while his massive body clenched and shuddered in reaction.<br> <br>Her thoughts were making her uneasy, making her want to wind her hair up into a knot and let the chill air cool her neck&#x2014;<br> <br>He cleared his throat. When she jerked her gaze to his face, he raised his eyebrows.<br> <br>Caught ogling the prey! The indignity! What is wrong with me? She had no more sexual urges than the walking-dead vampire before her. She shook herself, forcing herself to remember the last time she&#x2019;d faltered.<br> <br>On a battlefield, an age ago, she had spared and released another of this ilk, a young vampire soldier who had begged for his life.<br> <br>Yet he had seemed to scorn her for her very mercy. Without delay, the soldier had found her two full-blood sisters fighting in the flatlands below them. Alerted by a shriek from another Valkyrie, Kaderin had sprinted, stumbling down a hill draped with bodies, living and dead. Just as she&#x2019;d reached them, he&#x2019;d cut her sisters down.<br> <br>The younger, Rika, had been taken off-guard, because of Kaderin&#x2019;s panicked approach. The vampire had smiled when Kaderin dropped to her knees.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d dispatched her sisters with a brutal efficiency Kaderin had since emulated. She&#x2019;d like to say she started with him, but she&#x2019;d kept him alive for a time.<br> <br>So, why would she repeat the same mistake? She wouldn&#x2019;t. She would not ignore a lesson she had paid so dearly to learn.<br> <br>The sooner I get this done, the sooner I can begin preparing for the Hie.<br> <br>Squaring her shoulders, she steeled herself. It&#x2019;s all in the follow-through. Kaderin could see the swing, knew the angle she would take so that his head would remain on his neck until he fell. It was cleaner that way. Which was important.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d packed her suitcase lightly.</p><h2>Pioneers</h2><p>Reproductions of paintings, drawings, and photographs highlight a study of the men and women who opened and settled the American West</p><p></p><h2>The Cherokee Nation</h2><p>Brief historical coverage of the Cherokee Indians and their forced relocation to Oklahoma from multiple states over a period of years</p><p></p><h2>Winter: An Alphabet Acrostic</h2><p>A vibrant alphabet book, filled with linoleum-cut illustrations, contains twenty-six acrostic poems that capture the many joys and wonders of winter, from sledding downhill on newly fallen snow to animals nestled deep in underground burrows.</p><p>Steven Schnur is the author of many books for children and has received the Sydney Taylor Award for his contribution to Jewish children's literature.

The beauty of a snowy winter contrasts with the warmth of a cozy, country home in this playful picture book. On each page, a winter-related word provides the basis for an acrostic that reads like a short poem. For the letter <i>C, </i>the verse reads, "Crystals / Of ice as delicate as / Lace ring the / Duck pond," forming the word <i>cold</i> in uppercase letters. A striking, hand-colored linoleum print illustrates each small, boxed acrostic. A girl and her black dog appear in many of the pictures, as they do in the author-illustrator team's similar books, <i>Autumn</i> (1997), <i>Spring</i> (1999), and <i>Summer</i> (2001). As the season progresses, the child sleds and skates, then snuggles up indoors by a fire. The final illustration launches the girl into spring with a soccer ball. Younger children will enjoy studying the details and spotting the dog; older ones may be inspired to try their hand at the pleasure of acrostics. <i>Kathleen Odean</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By the end of the century, however, the most profitable corporations and banks in the country lent money to millions of American debtors. How did this happen? The first book to follow the history of personal debt in modern America, Debtor Nation traces the evolution of debt over the course of the twentieth century, following its transformation from fringe to mainstream--thanks to federal policy, financial innovation, and retail competition.How did banks begin making personal loans to consumers during the Great Depression? Why did the government invent mortgage-backed securities? Why was all consumer credit, not just mortgages, tax deductible until 1986? Who invented the credit card? Examining the intersection of government and business in everyday life, Louis Hyman takes the reader behind the scenes of the institutions that made modern lending possible: the halls of Congress, the boardrooms of multinationals, and the back rooms of loan sharks. America's newfound indebtedness resulted not from a culture in decline, but from changes in the larger structure of American capitalism that were created, in part, by the choices of the powerful--choices that made lending money to facilitate consumption more profitable than lending to invest in expanded production. From the origins of car financing to the creation of subprime lending, Debtor Nation presents a nuanced history of consumer credit practices in the United States and shows how little loans became big business.<br></p><p><p>"<i>Debtor Nation</i> explains how in recent decades American consumers and households got more and more access to credit at the very time they became less and less able to handle the resulting debts. The recent financial crisis and the anemic recovery from the resulting Great Recession have exposed this Achilles heel of modern finance. Louis Hyman's illuminating history shows how financial innovations sponsored by government, banks, and Wall Street induced Americans to shoot themselves in the foot by trying to live beyond their means. Sadly, now the party's over."<b>--Richard Sylla, New York University</b></p><p>"This revelatory book explores the hidden history of the complex web of personal credit and debt that unraveled in the recent financial crisis. Louis Hyman persuasively shows that the infrastructure of debt has been decades in the making and been driven by a perverse and often unforeseen combination of market forces and government policies. This should be required reading for students of consumer culture, the history of capitalism, and anyone who wants to know why Americans are now drowning in debt. A pathbreaking, important book."<b>--Stephen A.

Here she presents her memoirs which begin in classy apartments on Park Lane before the Crash, include a wild and funny time as an actress in Paris and London, and reveal all about her disastrous marriage to theater critic Kenneth Tynan. Her literary and theatrical circle&#x2014;which included Peter Finch, Tennesse Williams, Hemingway, and Gore Vidal&#x2014;is presented along with poignant remembrances of growing up in America in the 40s, and a literary and theatrical life in Paris and London.</p><p>From the celebrated author of <b>The Dud Avocado</b> <p>Elaine Dundy was born in New York in the 1920s and raised on Park Avenue. After the war, she decided the stage was her true home; she headed first to Paris and then London, where she met Kenneth Tynan and cabled home: &#x201c;Have married Englishman. Letter follows.&#x201d;Self&#x2013;invented, divorced from their backgrounds &#x201c;we looked on each other with absolute certainty that nobody quite like us had ever existed.&#x201d;They had a daughter, and Elaine gave up acting, but although their marriage was intoxicating, it was far from easy. The successful publication in 1958 of her first novel finished off the marriage. But it was the opening of a new world of writers for Elaine Dundy, including friendships with Tennessee Williams, Ernest Hemingway, and Gore Vidal. She went on to write biographies, including the story of her friend Peter Finch <b>(Finch, Bloody Finch),</b> and then surprised everyone with a groundbreaking biography of Elvis Presley and his mother &#x2014; <b>Elvis and Gladys.</b></p>Elaine Dundy was born in New York. As an actress she worked in Paris and London and then became a writer. She has written plays, biographies and novels including the bestselling THE DUD AVOCADO, her first novel.</p><h2>Bones of the Moon</h2><p>A bizarre series of dreams set in Rondua, a psychedelic fantasy landscape, provides Cullen, a young Manhattan wife, with an odd fulfillment until her dream world spills over into New York reality</p><p><p><b>Jonathan Carroll</b> has written 13 novels, a short story collection, and a number of film scripts.

We were friendly because he was forever walking an ugly little dog I patted when I bumped into them in the hall.<br>As you've seen from the pictures, he was nothing special to look at. The only odd thing I noticed was his eyeglasses: they were almost always dirty--that foggy, smudged look which makes you want to take out your own hanky and give them a good cleaning.<br>"A good boy." Why do newspapers always use terms like that? "Everyone who knew him thought of the murderer as a good boy who loved his parents, was a member of the Eagle Scouts and spent his spare time collecting Asian stamps."<br>Even my wonderful husband Danny said that after most of the grisly details came out. "He seemed like a good kid, didn't he, Cullen? 'Axe Boy'? Jesus, what a thing to call someone!"<br>"Danny, our young friend 'Axe Boy' Alvin Williams chopped his mother and sister into <i>pieces</i> exactly one floor below our apartment. A good boy he is <i>not</i>."<br>Danny had that quality and most of the time I loved him very much for it: the world is to be forgiven. Axe Boys, dogs that shit in the middle of the sidewalk, dangerous drivers...they know not what they do.<br><i>I</i> forgive nothing. If you stole my orange crayon in the fifth grade, you're still on my hit list, buster.<br>We were eating breakfast and Danny was reading the story to me from the paper. The thought of that murderous creep snoozing below us not long before still made my fanny tingle.<br>"He says he didn't know what came over him."<br>"Oh, really? Well, I hope the next thing that comes over him is a noose!"<br>"Cullen, you've interrupted me four times since I began reading this article to you. Would you like me to go on, or would you rather do a monologue?"<br>But he smiled when he said this because he wasn't really angry. When Danny got angry, he became quiet. Then you ran and hid under the bed for a very long time until he spoke again.<br>"You can go on, but he doesn't deserve any sympathy."<br>Danny ruffled the paper and cleared his throat. "He said he didn't know what came over him because he loved his mother and sister very much." He shook his head. "My God, what would it be like if that was your kid?" He looked at me as if I had the answer. "Whenever you see the parents of a kid like this on television, being interviewed, they always look so hurt and confused. All that time and effort they've put in over the years. The new bicycles they bought, trips to the doctor, packages from Grandma...So what ends up happening? Mom borrows his pen and for some reason he goes totally berserk. I wonder if it was this bad in the old days?"<br>"Danny, please don't start. 'The old days' were probably just as bad as now; people just use them as an excuse to condemn things."<br>"I'm not going to 'star'. It's just that whenever I read about something like this, I get all guilty. You know what I mean? Why should we be so lucky? We still love each other, the baby's great, I make good money...."<br>He shrugged and drank his coffee. There wasn't anything I could say because he was right--we <i>were</i> lucky people, and if I could do anything about it, it would stay that way for the next fifty years.<br>* * *<br>&nbsp;I fell in love with Danny James when it was unfashionable to fall in love with anything but causes. Spell that with a capital "C," please. That was back in the 1970s when everybody hated the war in Vietnam and stores sold only incense and tacky Indian clothes by the million. I shouldn't be so snotty, because I wore too much patchouli perfume and carried my very own copy of <i>The Prophet</i> with me wherever I went. Thank God things change. Is there anyone around whose past doesn't make them cringe?<br>We met in college in New Jersey and were introduced by the girl Danny later married--Evelyn Hernuss, who was my roommate in freshman year.<br>He was in love with her. But at the time I was in love with Jim Vanderberg, so I didn't pay much attention to Danny James. Jim and I were convinced we were destined to get married and go off to a Peace Corps posting in some ravaged section of the world, where they would desperately need us and we would go around feeling like little saints for a couple of years. But the worm turns!<br>Jim and I later broke up over an advanced case of apathy. And three months after their marriage in junior year, Evelyn Hernuss James died in a car crash with her mother and father on their way home from one of Danny's basketball games.<br>I had taken the semester off to campaign for a Presidential peace candidate and was in Chicago when I heard about her death. There was little I could do besides write Danny a letter telling him how sorry I was. Evelyn was one of the good ones--all the way down the line.<br>In what seemed a week, I received a thick letter back from Danny, spilling every gut he had on to the page. I wrote back and he wrote back and I wrote back...And when I returned in the winter, he met me at Newark Airport looking like someone who had barely survived Dachau. He looked so bad he scared me.<br>All of my "Earth Mother" instincts woke right up. Believe me, I had no intention of loving him--I was there to be his friend in need. I had also decided I was going to be "off" love that semester. I was going to be serious, chaste, industrious, unapproachable...and eat only whole-grain foods.<br>We spent a lot of time together. He needed someone he could cry in front of; I needed someone who would make me feel a little less self-involved. Things worked out fine.<br>That was the year he set a school record for scoring and, hate sports as much as I did, I went to as many games as possible. At the beginning I sat in the stands and did my homework, but I couldn't help admiring how smooth and graceful he looked on the court. Soon I stopped doing my homework, became a great fan and knew more about basketball than a serious girl should.<br>When college was over, Danny was offered two tryouts with professional teams, but true to his Marco Polo nature, he decided to play for a team in Milan instead. I thought it was a nice idea but nuts at the same time--and had no hesitation in telling him that. He shrugged and said he didn't want to play basketball for the rest of his life anyway, so here was a way he could play and see things at the same time without the pressure and worry of big-time American pro sports.<br>European pro basketball turned out to be rough and often about as subtle as a brick over the head. The finesse and ballet of the game at its best in the United States is lost. American players who come over are often appalled at the steamroller way they go at it in the "elegant" part of the world.<br>Danny's letters to me that first year abroad were full of wonderful descriptions of games played in youth centers, military bases, gymnasiums that doubled as town halls. The team gave him a car that blew up, and just enough money to keep his elephant's appetite at bay.<br>I was working for a magazine in New York as a researcher and feeling lonely most of the time. Live in New York when you're rich or in love, but avoid it when all you have is a job, a smelly apartment on Tenth Street and an empty dance card. That was the year I spent devouring all the books you're only supposed to read at the beach in the summer. I learned how to cook, and thanked God someone had had the compassion to invent television.<br>During the day I would call places like Alaska and ask distant-voiced scientists about the mating habits of the musk-ox. I was good at my job because I had too much time on my hands and didn't mind putting in extra hours, asking a million extra questions and making perfect copies of my research reports.<br>I dated a bunch of men with names like Richard and Christopher (multisyllable names were "in" again) who, when taken together, didn't add up to one Danny James. His letters from Italy were full of freshness and life. The guys I was seeing were trying their damnedest to be cool and wise and infallible. They took me to grim Bulgarian movies (in the original language) and then explained the story to me afterward in lousy coffeehouses. Danny liked to talk about the funny mistakes he'd made and how silly he'd looked or felt as a result. He would write a whole letter about a meal of bad pasta that would make me laugh out loud. So many of the sentences had his face. Unfortunately for the Richards and Christophers, I would inevitably receive one of these treasured letters a few hours before a date with one of them and, as a result, I'd be a grump all night.<br>Yet, just before summer arrived that year, I did something incredibly stupid. Tired of being efficient by day and lonely by night, I went to bed with a beautiful German photographer named Peter (pronounced "Pay-ter") who made me swoon in my seat the first time he entered the office. Casual affairs had always repelled me, but I had never really experienced lust at first sight. I slept with him on our second date. He took me out for dinner in a very tall building that had a view over all of Manhattan. We ate the most delicious things on the menu and he talked about the ruins of Petra, the game the Afghanis play called <i>bushkhazi</i>, an evening he'd spent at a caf� in Alexandria with Lawrence Durrell.<br>He never looked me in the eye once in all the times we went to bed in the next months. He preferred to rest his handsome chin on my shoulder every time we "made love." He wasn't good and he wasn't bad: he was just "Pay-ter" who told wonderful stories and expected you to do more than he did once you were in bed. Since there was little else in my life then besides letters from the distant Danny James, I convinced myself I was in love with Peter.<br>Psychologists say you should never go food shopping when you're hungry, because at that point everything you see looks delicious and you buy strictly on impulse. Popcorn, oysters...it doesn't make any sense because your stomach is saying yes to everything, whether it's logical or nutritious or just junk. I met Peter when I was hungry and everything he was looked like a feast.<br>When I found out I was pregnant, it t...</p><h2>The Only Answer to Success: You were born to be a Champion</h2><p>The Only Answer to Success contains a proven formula for changing your mind-set to that of a true &#x201c;champion.&#x201d; Based on thousands of hours of research and personal experience, Dr. Leonard Coldwell has come up with a proven way to retrain your mind to achieve any goal or get through any challenge with zero stress.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Lawrence arrived with his wife, Frieda, at the railroad station in Lamy, New Mexico. They had traveled from Australia to San Francisco, then to Lamy, to come to Taos at the invitation of Mabel Dodge Sterne, later Mabel Dodge Luhan, the patroness of arts and culture in Taos. It was the beginning of an intense, sometimes strained, relationship. Mabel, daughter of a well-to-do Buffalo, New York family, had a long history of cultivating arts and letters, surrounding herself with famous artists and writers in her salons in Florence, Italy and in New York City. She continued her support of literature and the arts in Taos. Lawrence encouraged Mabel to write about her own exciting life and, while back in Italy in 1925, continued corresponding with Mabel and edited manuscripts she sent to him. Her book, &#34;Lorenzo in Taos,&#34; is written loosely in the form of letters to and from D. H. Lawrence, Frieda Lawrence, and Robinson Jeffers, the celebrated poet who had been a guest of Mabel&#39;s in Taos, with references to Dorothy Brett and Spud Johnson among others. The book is a highly personal and most informative account of an intense relationship with a great writer. It is an important work and its reprinting is welcomed by scholars and those of us who have come increasingly to respect Mabel&#39;s contributions in the world of arts and letters through her support of many individuals and her own creative spirit.</p><p>Born in 1879 to a wealthy Buffalo family, Mabel Dodge Luhan earned fame for her friendships with American and European artists, writers and intellectuals and for her influential salons held in her Italian villa and Greenwich Village apartments. In 1917, weary of society and wary of a world steeped in war, she set down roots in remote Taos, New Mexico, then publicized the tiny town&#39;s inspirational beauty to the world, drawing a steady stream of significant guests to her adobe estate, including artist Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, poet Robinson Jeffers, and authors D. H. Lawrence and Willa Cather. Luhan could be difficult, complex and often cruel, yet she was also generous and supportive, establishing a solid reputation as a patron of the arts and as an author of widely read autobiographies. She died in Taos in 1962.</p><h2>Good Work, Amelia Bedelia</h2><p>Amelia Bedelia, the mixed-up maid everyone loves, is up to her old tricks again.

Robert Edgerton begins this sweeping chronicle by describing the role of African armies in pre-colonial times, when armed forces or militias were essential to the maintenance and prosperity of their societies. During the colonial era, African soldiers fought with death-defying courage, earning such respect as warriors that they were often recruited into the colonial armies not simply to enforce colonial rule in Africa, but to fight for the European homelands as well. After independence swept through Africa, African military men seized political power in country after country, ruling dictatorially for their own benefit and for that of their kinsmen and cronies. The author describes the post-colonial civil wars that have devastated much of sub-Saharan Africa &#x2013; catastrophes marked by genocide, famine, disease, economic collapse, and steadily declining life expectancy. He closes by describing the role that Africa's military forces can and must play if the future is to bring better times to the continent's many peoples.</p><p><b>Robert B. Edgerton</b> is the author of more than twenty other books on a variety of sociological, anthropological, and historical topics, most recently <i>Hidden Heroism</i> (Westview 2001). He also teaches anthropology at the UCLA School of Medicine.This is a deeply disturbing book, precisely because of its author's broad knowledge of, and deep sympathy for, sub-Saharan Africa. Edgerton (The Fall of the Asante Empire) romanticizes both the pre-colonial experience and the pre-independence insurgencies to a degree, but makes the point that African armies have fought in most cases with honor, sparing noncombatants even under the stresses of revolution. He is correspondingly at a loss to explain the behavior he describes in his next three chapters. What began in a context of corrupt and inefficient governance as a pattern of military coups and assassinations (totaling over 100 since decolonization), has increasingly degenerated into virtually random mass slaughters, for which Edgerton provides a compendium, from Liberia to the Sudan and back to Sierra Leone. By the time he finishes, the atrocities blur into each other and one account of torture or cannibalism seems just inexplicably horrific as the next. The common thread, however, is that these events have virtually nothing to do with armies or warfare. The perpetrators are not soldiers, whatever they may call themselves-and often, indeed, no longer even bother with such trappings as uniforms and chains of command. The most extensive and the one Edgerton describes in greatest detail, the mutual Hutu-Tutsi genocides of the 1990s, involved populations butchering each other; armed forces were vestigial. Edgerton is better at describing the phenomenon than explaining it. While sharply and legitimately critical of European failures to build infrastructures that sustain modern states, he eschews vulgar West-bashing. At the same time he is reluctant to accept the arguments of those African intellectuals who interpret African culture as structurally maladaptive. In the end he issues a generalized call for African armies to redevelop a professional ethic and rediscover their historic social roles. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dragon of Lonely Island</h2><p><b>A beguiling fantasy about the vacation of a lifetime.</b><br><br>Hannah, Zachary, and Sarah Emily are spending the summer at their Great Aunt Mehitabel&#x2019;s house on faraway Lonely Island. There, in a cave hidden high above the ocean, they discover a fabulous creature: a glittering three-headed golden dragon with a kind heart, an unpredictable temper, and a memory that spans 20,000 years. Transported by the magic of the dragon&#x2019;s stories, the children meet Mei-lan, a young girl in ancient China; nineteenth-century cabin boy Jamie Pritchett; and, in more recent times, Hitty and her brother Will, who survive a frightening plane crash on a desert island. In this fluidly written novel, Rebecca Rupp explores what three children from the present learn from the past - and from an unlikely, but wise and generous friend.</p><p>Rebecca Rupp lives in Vermont with her husband and three sons, three cats, and a large garden full of heirloom tomatoes. Of THE DRAGON OF LONELY ISLAND, she says, &#34;We once had an invisible pet dragon named Petunia, plus did an awful lot of childhood reading.&#34;They strode along, single file because the old path was so narrow. Sarah Emily hummed as she walked. Zachary paused every once in a while to check directions on his compass. Hannah dabbed sunscreen on her nose. Soon Zachary and Sarah Emily were hungry again-"I can't believe you two, after eating all those doughnuts," said Hannah-so they paused, just at the foot of the hill, for a sandwich (peanut butter and Mrs. Jones's homemade strawberry jam), a cookie, and a drink of lemonade. Zachary's freckles began to come out in the sun. Sarah Emily crumpled the last sandwich wrapper and tucked it back into Zachary's pack. "Let's go to the very top," she said, "and look for China."<br>"Wrong direction and wrong ocean," said Hannah. "Try France."<br>"Or Greenland," said Zachary. "Last one to the top is a rotten egg!" He grabbed the pack and began to run, bounding up the little path, winding in and out around scattered boulders. <br>Hannah and Sarah Emily-shouting "Hey!" and "Wait for me!"-dashed after him. <br>The hill was steeper than it looked. Soon the children were breathless, and one after another they slowed, panting, to a walk. They were hot, and the backs of Sarah Emily's legs began to ache. They staggered up the last few feet and collapsed, laughing, against the huge heap of piled rocks that formed the very peak of Drake's Hill. Zachary raised his fist in triumph. "Excelsior!" he shouted.<br>The view from the hill was spectacular. From their height, they could trace the coast of the island and gaze far out to sea. "I feel like I've just climbed Mount Everest," said Hannah. <br>"Let's get right up on top of these rocks," said Zachary. "Then we'll be able to see everything in both directions."<br>They scrambled up the side of the great heap of gray boulders, scrabbling for footholds as they climbed. The rocks were piled like giant jumbled steps. There were short heaving climbs-Sarah Emily, whose legs were short, needed to be boosted by Zachary and Hannah-then expanses of level flatness, then more steep climbs. At the last flat step, as they approached the peak, they came to a smooth, sheer wall, higher than Hannah's head, with not so much as a crack or a crevice in sight. "Let's go back," said Sarah Emily. "It's too high."<br>But Zachary refused to give up.<br>"Maybe we can get up from the other side," he said.<br>The step-more like a rocky shelf-curved around to the right, almost like a walkway circling the very top of the hill. The children cautiously edged their way around it. Sarah Emily, who hated heights, refused to look down. On the north side of the rock face, the shelf suddenly widened out into a broad platform, high above and overlooking the empty sea.<br>"Look at that!" gasped Sarah Emily.<br>"A cave!" said Zachary. <br>At the back of the stone platform, a wide gaping opening led back into darkness.<br>"Let's go inside," said Zachary eagerly, but Sarah Emily hung back. <br>"Let's not," she said. "There could be anything in there. Bears or something. And besides, it smells funny."<br>Zachary and Hannah sniffed the air. Near the cave entrance, there was a strange odor: the smell of charcoal and smoke, with a hint of something tangier, spicy, alien. <br>"Probably just old campfires," said Zachary. "Maybe Mr. and Mrs. Jones used to come up here and roast marshmallows." He peered blindly into the darkness, then turned to fumble in his backpack. "Just a minute," he said. "I brought my flashlight."<br>He switched it on and cautiously stepped forward into the cave. Sarah Emily and Hannah crowded behind him. The three children, clinging to each other, edged slowly inward. As they moved into the cave, the sound of the sea abruptly shut off, as though someone had thrown a massive switch. The cave floor seemed to slant downward into the hill, and inside, it felt enormous; there was a sense of soaring sub-<br>terranean spaces. Zachary's flashlight barely penetrated the gloom. "It didn't look this big from the outside," Sarah Emily whispered. Groping, they stretched out their arms, left and right, to the sides.<br>"Can anybody feel a wall anywhere?" Zachary asked softly. Nobody could.<br>"This place is simply huge," said Hannah. "The whole inside of the hill must be hollow."<br>"It feels endless," said Sarah Emily nervously.<br>The children shuffled forward, feeling gingerly with their feet. "There could be deep holes," said Sarah Emily. The strange sharp smell-smoke? sulfur?-got stronger.<br>"You know what I wonder?" said Zachary. "Where did this hill get its name anyway? Was the sea captain who built the house named Drake? How come it's called Drake's Hill?"<br>There was a sudden shifting sound from the back of the cave, a heavy sandpapery scraping noise. Then there came a soft hiss in the darkness-the sound of a lighted blowtorch, thought Zachary-and a red-and-yellow flare of flame. The interior of the cave leaped into light. Before the children's astonished eyes, a vast expanse of gold flashed and glittered. There before them lay a long reptilian body, curled comfortably on the cave floor, with a coiled golden tail, ending in a flat arrowhead-shaped point. Two eyes-sharp slits of jade green-glared at them out of the darkness.<br>"It is called Drake's Hill, young man," said a deep, raspy voice, "because drake is an ancient and honorable name for dragon. The hill is named after me."<br><br>THE DRAGON OF LONELY ISLAND by Rebecca Rupp. Copyright (c) 1998 by Rebecca Rupp. Published by Candlewick Press, Inc., Cambridge, MA.</p><h2>Gold Nugget-Teering and Prospecting in Nevada: Book 1</h2><p>A book for gold nugget searching in Nevada is long over-due....Precise information along with maps to the gold sites and gold areas.....Placer gold areas listed with geological info. and generous maps accompanying each text.....A waybill for Nevada&#39;s rich&#39;s.....No other book like it nor can any other book compare with it&#39;s information....Money well spent for this interesting Nevada book is a gold searcher&#39;s dream come true....The maps presented will get the searcher right into the precise area of interest....Metal detecting for gold nuggets made easier with Delos Toole&#39;s generous use of maps....Nevada&#39;s out-back is comparable to Australia&#39;s out-back for gold nugget searching.

Supernatural strength during emergencies. These are examples of what average people have done under extraordinary circumstances. The Meta-Human can do these things at will. When you get the conscious mind out of your way, the rest of your consciousness can communicate its knowledge. This is how the Meta-Human accomplishes what he or she does. This Handbook offers the tools that will assist you in becoming a Meta-Human, reaching beyond your perceived limitations and accomplishing what most think is impossible!</p><p>Paul Solomon was a Meta-Human, a remarkable man who lived his life in service to exemplify and teach the ultimate possibilities of human potential. He was highly acclaimed as a prophet, sage, lecturer, philosopher, counselor, minister, magician, psychic and miracle worker. He was lauded as one of the most dynamic and insightful teachers of our time as he lectured around the world. <p>The son of a Baptist minister, Paul was steeped in the Bible from early childhood. He attended seminary with the goal of following in his father's footsteps as a minister, but a shattering personal experience forced him to leave his studies. Five years of rebellion and depression followed until a powerful mystical experience changed his life forever. The experience took him beyond the limiting realm of the five physical senses into the Separate Reality of a Higher World. </p><p>He was catapulted instantly into new life, a new relationship with God, and a new ministry. He spent the rest of his life studying, learning, and teaching what he called Inner Light Consciousness, a guided experience in spiritual evolution, and from that he developed other related lectures and workshops. His goal was to help people find their own Inner Light without having to go through what he did to discover their potential. He encouraged the development of a close, personal relationship with God, the Source of our being, a relationship in which we can confidently ask questions and receive answers whenever guidance is needed. </p><p>Paul was unique in his ability to explain complicated concepts in clear and precise language that is easy to understand. His teachings still are practical and applicable to every day life. His topics cover a wide range of knowledge and experience and include soul growth, altered states of consciousness and awareness, ancient mystery traditions and arcane knowledge, comparative religion, Sacred Scripture, Qabalah, Universal Law, holistic healing and many other facets of human existence. His workshops in personal transformation, including Unconditional Love, Emotions Mastery, Effective Communication, Loving Relationships and others, go beyond behavior modification to produce lasting change that occurs within. </p><p>Paul's love of the Bible grew and he could make the stories come alive. He received a doctorate from the New Seminary of New York City. He shared podiums with such luminaries as Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Sir George Trevelyan, Buddhist Priestess Tamo San, Dr. Jerry Jampolski, Buckminister Fuller, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Founders of the Findhorn Community Peter and Eileen Caddy, Jean Houston, Sun Bear, Manly Palmer Hall, Marcus Bach and many others. </p><p>In his later years, he expanded his work to help the less fortunate. After serving as a volunteer with Mother Teresa in India, he formed the organization Dignity International. For his efforts particularly on behalf of the enslaved children and refugees of Thailand, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. </p><p>Paul brought together people of diverse nations, races and religions, honoring all of life and transcending boundaries. He empowered people to express their full potential.</p></p><h2>Autumn In April</h2><p>&#34;They stared at each other in dismay...So this was Matthieu, the grandson Gaspard had assured her would welcome and look after her until his return.

Now in one volume, the poems from these three books can be seen as the work of one of American poetry's most original and challenging poets.</p></p><p><p><b>Lawrence Joseph</b>'s fourth book of poems,<i> Into It</i>, was published by FSG in hardcover in September 2005. He lives in downtown Manhattan and is a professor of law at St. John's University School of Law.</p>Joseph is an attorney as well as a poet, which accounts for the legal tone of the title of his retrospective collection, <i>Codes, Precepts, Biases, and Taboos</i>. Joseph also has a penchant for reasoning, yet these are molten works, and reading through his earlier poems is to journey through his poetic and philosophical development. Beneath the stable crust of memory is a search for identity. Joseph delves into his ancestry by considering his Lebanese and Syrian Catholic grandparents' homelands and history, and their place as Arab emigrants in the U.S. Through reflection on this heritage and the violence of his Detroit childhood, Joseph ponders anger, choice, and fate. <i>Into It</i>, which collects his newest work, reveals a different poetic voice, one that is more abstract and fluid. Here Joseph is less narrative-based and more symbolic, less angry and more disillusioned, less personal and more universal. Many lyrics seem "coded" with essayistic digressions that gracefully intertwine question, observation, and emotion. Being a New Yorker in a 9/11 world has certainly resonated with Joseph, and the melancholy, grief, and hope of so many people coming to grips with large-scale violence is palpable. Many of these poems are deftly painted (perhaps an influence from his painter wife) with feeling as brushstroke, judgment as perspective, language as dimension, metaphor as theme. <i>Janet St. John</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He is introducing into this country the gangster methods of Chicago and New York... Trade depression has thrown into unemployment thousands of unskilled youths who have nothing to do but lounge about the street corners of our slums in gangs.&#39; John Bull weekly newspaper, 1932.During the 1920s and 1930s, Glasgow gained an unenviable and enduring notoriety as Britain&#39;s gang city - the &#39;Scottish Chicago&#39;. Now Andrew Davies, author of the acclaimed The Gangs of Manchester, brings to life the reign of terror exerted on Glasgow by gangs like the Billy Boys, the Kent Star, the Savoy Arcadians and the South Side Stickers. Out of the most dilapidated and overcrowded tenements in Britain, stepped young men and women dressed like Hollywood gangsters and their molls. On the city&#39;s streets, they took centre stage in dramas of their own making, fighting territorial battles laced with religious sectarianism and running protection rackets modelled on those of the American underworld.Drawing on fifteen years of original research, Andrew Davies provides compelling portraits of legendary figures such as &#39;Razor King&#39; John Ross and Billy Fullerton, leader of the Billy Boys - described as the &#39;Al Capone&#39; of the city&#39;s East End. He sheds new light on the way the city&#39;s police and judiciary dealt with the gangs and reveals the fascinating role played by the media in creating myths of the underworld. During what the Daily Express described as &#39;The War on the Gang&#39;, Glasgow&#39;s police were led by Chief Constable Percy Sillitoe (who later became head of M15), determined to maintain the image as a tough, gang-busting cop he had forged in Sheffield during the 1920s</p><p>Andrew Davies is a Senior Lecturer in Modern British History at the University of Liverpool. He specialises in the history of crime in modern Britain and has published and broadcast widely on gangs, crime and policing. His previous book The Gangs of Manchester was published in 2008.

Even with the starlight and the feeble seepage from the streetlamps around the corner, my eyes took longer to adjust than I expected. <br>The police officer at the bottom of the Arch Street alley looked up at me quizzically as I hesitated beside my car, my hands burrowing deep inside my pockets. &#x201c;You okay, Lieutenant?&#x201d; He was stringing a yellow &#x201c;Police Line&#x201d; tape across the way. <br>I shuddered and nodded, walking down the paved incline, careful of its neglected, broken surface. &#x201c;Sure, Bobby. Still half asleep.&#x201d; <br>He lifted the tape to let me pass. &#x201c;Know what you mean. I been on nights for a week already. Still can&#x2019;t get used to it.&#x201d; <br>He was fresh from the academy, eager and curious, and if statistics were any guide, either destined to learn the ropes with us, and then enter the private sector, disillusioned and bored, or angle a job with the state police, assuming he passed their scrutiny. <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s here already?&#x201d; I asked him. <br>&#x201c;Detectives Klesczewski and Tyler. Officer Lavoie&#x2019;s with them. Sheila Kelly&#x2019;s closing the other end off.&#x201d; <br>I smiled at his titling everyone except Sheila. It wasn&#x2019;t sexist. She&#x2019;d been his supervisor, before we&#x2019;d let him loose on his own. She was the reverse of the trend, ten years with the Burlington PD, come to us in search of a slightly mellower pace. Bobby looked to her as a kid might to an older sister. <br>I continued to the corner, where the Main Street buildings above and behind me showed their backs to the train tracks and the Connecticut River beyond. Typical of many old, red-brick New England towns, Brattleboro, Vermont faced away from the serenity and beauty of the river, having chosen well over a hundred-and-fifty years ago to regard both it and the railroad paralleling it as unsightly commercial conduits. In its heyday, this stretch of ground, unseen by the gentry, had been a coarse and bustling string of loading docks and receiving bays, feeding businesses two floors above, whose windows had glittered with the primped and polished end results. <br>Now the area was forlorn and ignored, a parking place for dumpsters, the homeless, and for teenagers seeking illicit time alone. High overhead, out of sight in the gloom, dotting the curved, fortress-like wall following the river&#x2019;s bend, were hundreds of dingy rear apartments, an increasing number of which were being transformed into tastefully renovated lofts or rendered by the town&#x2019;s excess of psychologists and therapists into peaceful, sunlit havens-drawn to the very scenery that their predecessors had ignored. Most, however, still belonged to the marginally solvent-welfare dwellers holed up in small, dark, cluttered dens, surrounded by commerce, and benefiting from none of it. <br>With theatrical abruptness, a tripod-mounted halogen lamp burst the darkness ahead of me with a brief electrical hiss. It was facing away from me, down and across the tracks, so the effect wasn&#x2019;t blinding, but more fancifully melodramatic. Its harsh light destroyed any subtlety or nuance, revealing everything in its arc in angular, brittle starkness &#x2013; while consigning everything outside it to simple nonexistence. The soiled, damaged brick walls; the cinder-stained gravel of the railroad bed; the parallel crescent of gleaming tracks, and the flat black slab of river water beyond &#x2015; were all briefly frozen in that initial flash of light, like a startled, disheveled partygoer caught in the glare of an instant camera. And just as quickly, it all became mere background to the item at center stage-and the reason for our gathering in the middle of a freezing January night. <br>Perpendicular to the outermost track, his feet toward the river, lay a man in a thick, long, dirty coat. He had no head or hands-they&#x2019;d all been resting on the track when the last train had passed by, and what was left of them didn&#x2019;t merit much description. But they lent the scene its one source of bright color, and to the entire picture a grim sense of purpose. <br>Standing over the body was Ron Klesczewski, that night&#x2019;s detective on call. J. P. Tyler, our forensics man, had just plugged in the lamp. <br>He moved away from its glare and joined me in the darkness, like a technician stepping offstage to check his work. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see calling the paramedics. Got hold of everybody else-the ME, the SA&#x2019;s office, more backup. Gail not on tonight?&#x201d; <br>Gail Zigman was a deputy state&#x2019;s attorney, and the woman I lived with. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;I forgot to ask who was when I left.&#x201d; I gestured with my chin down the tracks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;ve we got?&#x201d; <br>Tyler shrugged. &#x201c;Little early to tell, and I don&#x2019;t want to do too much before the ME gets here, but it looks like a bum who ran out of rope.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Suicide?&#x201d; I asked mildly. <br>&#x201c;Probably. Although you don&#x2019;t usually find them with their hands on the track.&#x201d; <br>Before moving any closer, I said, more to myself than to him, &#x201c;Unless he was already dead.&#x201d;</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>A King&#39;s Commander (Volume 7) (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures, 7)</h2><p>Alan Lewrie is now commander of HMS Jester, an 18-gun sloop.

In Eric Overmyer's chimerical new comedy, three Victorian lady explorers set out on an adventure that takes them to darkest Africa, highest Himalaya and Terra Incognita....<br> Blending Tom Stoppard's limber linguistics with the historic overview of a Thornton Wilder, Mr Overmyer takes his audience on a mirthful safari...spinning into time travel.<br> Three `sister sojourners', each a prototypical Victorian lady explorer, equipped with dialog as pithy as their helmets, thwack their machetes through the wilderness while telling tales of past jaunts among the natives. As intrepid trekkers, they put the lie to any charge that they are representatives of a weaker sex. Mr Overmyer has written a play that is joyfully feminist.<br> Heroines to their heart, the explorers can accommodate themselves to any emergency (natural or man-made), although they are momentarily disoriented as they approach modern times. In their kaleidoscopic adventure, they journey through a rain forest of hundreds of artifacts from the future household utensils, mechanical contrivances and a side-view automobile mirror that reads `Objects in mirror may be closer than they appear'. How does one deal with such a chimera?... In the play there is wit within the palaver. As one traveler says, `I have seen the future and it is slang'. The author himself is an ecologist of language and a shrewd observer of our quest to control our environment and the environment of others.... A frolicsome jaunt through a continuum of space, time, history, geography, feminism and fashion, Mr Overmyer's cavalcade is on the verge of becoming a thoroughly serendipitous journey. --Mel Gussow, The New York Times<br><br>With a handful of plays...Eric Overmyer has established himself as one of contemporary theater's wittiest playwrights. --Jan Stuart, Seven Days<br><br>Eric Overmyer [is] one of this nation's most accomplished and vividly imaginative playwrights. --Wayne Johnson, The Seattle Times<br><br>With a handful of plays...Eric Overmyer has established himself as one of contemporary theater's wittiest playwrights. --Jan Stuart, Seven Days<br><br>Eric Overmyer [is] one of this nation's most accomplished and vividly imaginative playwrights. --Wayne Johnson, The Seattle Times</p><h2>Karate: Technique and Spirit</h2><p>The true essence of karate-do is integrated training of the body, mind, and spirit to fully achieve human potential.<i>Karate: Technique and Spirit</i> describes in detail all the steps necessary to attain this goal.

She already knew the basics: greenhouse gas emissions and global average temperatures are rising on a trajectory that could, within decades, propel us beyond far-reaching, irreversible atmospheric changes; the results could devastate the environment that enables humans to thrive. The more details she learned, the more she felt compelled to address this emerging crisis. The result is this book, an artful weaving together of the science behind rising temperatures, tumultuous weather events, and a lifetime devoted to the natural world. Climate change isn&#x2019;t just about melting Arctic ice and starving polar bears. It&#x2019;s weakening the web of life in our own backyards.<br> <br> Moving between two timelines, Mutel pairs chapters about a single year in her Iowa woodland with chapters about her life as a fledgling and then professional student of nature. Stories of her childhood ramblings in Wisconsin and the solace she found in the Colorado mountains during early adulthood are merged with accounts of global environmental dilemmas that have redefined nature during her lifespan. Interwoven chapters bring us into her woodland home to watch nature&#x2019;s cycles of life during a single year, 2012, when weather records were broken time and time again. Throughout, in a straightforward manner for a concerned general audience, Mutel integrates information about the science of climate change and its dramatic alteration of the planet in ways that clarify its broad reach, profound impact, and seemingly relentless pace.<br> <br> It is not too late, she informs us: we can still prevent the most catastrophic changes. We can preserve a world full of biodiversity, one that supports human lives as well as those of our myriad companions on this planet. In the end, Mutel offers advice about steps we can all take to curb our own carbon emissions and strategies we can suggest to our policy-makers. <br></p></p><p>Ecologist <b>Cornelia F.

There's clearly only one thing to do. Confronted by the cats' intense scrutiny, Widget meows, purrs, plays with a toy mouse, and uses the litter box. Having eventually convinced his new family of his felinity, Widget is soon living so happily he sometimes forgets his true nature. But when Mrs. Diggs takes a fall and doesn't get up, it's up to Widget to save the day with a particularly canine solution. <br><br>A very simple text and droll pictures make Widget a book to read again and again.</p><p>Lyn Rossiter McFarland&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jim McFarland&nbsp;have collaborated on several children's books, including <i>Widget &amp; </i><i>the Puppy </i>and <i>Mouse Went Out to Get a Snack</i>. They live in Livingston, New York.In this when-in-Rome story, a stray dog alters his canine ways to appease half-a-dozen grouchy cats. Widget, a scruffy Westie, wanders into a farmhouse where he finds "six cats, six warm beds, and six bowls of hot food." The well-fed cats glare at him. "I wish you could stay," says the grandmotherly caretaker, Mrs. Diggs. "But I'm afraid the girls just can't stand dogs." Widget utters a hopeful "Meow?" Thereafter, he adopts feline ways, until the inevitable emergency ("Mrs. Diggs... fell down. She didn't move") compels him to bark and save the day. The McFarlands, who imagined a teddy bear mimicking a bird in The Pirate's Parrot, once again depict an adaptable outsider. Widget's name aptly suggests an unspecific, versatile object. In Jim McFarland's pen-and-ink and watercolor wash illustrations, the ingratiating dog appears the same size as his adoptive sisters, with pointed ears and a scruffy, upraised tail; he even casts a cat-shaped shadow. This story line offers no surprises, but it gives a fond account of cross-species conciliation, and, at their best, the pictures of the hero attempting to adapt to his housemates' behavior hint at the sly wit of James Stevenson's artwork.

It is a place for starlets and would-be starlets, directors, studio execs, and the well-groomed lowlifes who cater to them. And, as imagined by Norman Mailer in this blistering classic of 1950s Hollywood, Desert D'Or is a moral proving ground, where men and women discover what they really want&#x2014;and how far the are willing to go to get it.<i>The Deer Park</i> is the story of two interlacing love affairs. Sergius O'Shaugnessy is a young ex-Air Force pilot whose good looks and air of indifference launch him into the orbit of the radiant actress Lulu Meyers. Charles Eitel is a brilliant director wounded by accusations of communism&#x2014;and whose liaison with the volatile Elena Esposito may supply the coup de grace to his career.

Quick and reliable to grow for summer colour, and well marketed, most gardeners will have at least one in their garden or conservatory, without realising either the number or variety of species available, nor the plant&#39;s extraordinary history. &#34;A Passion for Pelargoniums&#34; reveals the fascinating and dramatic tales of those who have been involved in finding, classifying, collecting and breeding the plants. It explodes the myth that all modern versions of the plant are descended from the oldest known variety - the seventeenth-century drab-coloured P. triste, literally translated as the sad pelargonium, and reveals that 2,000 hybrids have been developed from less than a dozen plants originally imported from the East. From the contribution of L&#39;Heritier, whom Sir Joseph Banks named &#39;an impudent Frenchman&#39;, to collectors like Masson and the Marquess of Blandford (known for his &#39;elegant emporium&#39;), competing nurserymen determined to make both fortunes and reputations, and the burgeoning Victorian varieties as growers searched for the holy grail of the scarlet geranium, the book recounts the plant&#39;s extraordinary history. Today, while traditional white ones, doubles, &#39;nosegays&#39; and &#39;rosebuds&#39; still flourish, the &#39;lemon-scented geranium&#39; is only one of a number of scented varieties, while pelargoniums can have flowers of pink, red, purple, yellow or black. This is the story of how the passion felt by gardeners for their plants stirred them to bitter rivalry and criminal obsession, scandal, fraud, and fast dealing, and saw polite society being rather less than polite.</p><p>Anne Wilkinson has a PhD in garden history. She has lectured on the subject, written academic papers for publications including Garden History and Hackney History, and contributed to Anna Pavord&#39;s series The Green Detectives on Radio 4.

Readers will hope that Willie will soon return in a sequel."<b>--Publishers Weekly</b><br><br>"Place and culture play such a vital part in this mystery, the question is not so much who-dun-it as what-isn't-he-telling and how-does-he-know. The narrator s voice is convincing throughout and the characters leap from the page. Acts of remembrance, compassion and love are redefined by accident, choice or conviction. And the reader is pulled into the realities and compromises of an imperfect world, made just perfect enough in this story to carry the weight of hope and a future." --Caf� Libre<br><br>"While the narrative is certainly compelling, what gives Oregon Hill a degree of heft is its commentary on the fate of print journalism in the digital age. To an extent, the novel decries the sad state of affairs created by the dwindling readership for traditional newspapers. At the same time, however, Owen is careful not to indulge in too much hand-wringing, as his protagonist is quick to recognize the value of so-called <i>new media</i> even if he's somewhat reluctant to embrace it. In this sense, Oregon Hill looks forward as much as it looks back, and offers a fairly complex look at our culture's current relationship with journalism. Reminiscent of Carl Hiaasen's Basket Case, Oregon Hill is as smart as it is thrilling, a true literary page-turner."--<b>Small Press Reviews</b><br><br>"If anyone is watching out for the forgotten citizens of Oregon Hill, it's Willie, who grew up there and speaks the local language, a crisp and colorful urban idiom we can't wait to hear again." --The New York Times</p><h2>Secrets of Salsa / Secretos De La Salsa: A Bilingual Cookbook (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Secrets of Salsa: A Bilingual Cookbook by the Mexican Women of Anderson Valley. 25 assorted Salsa recipes from traditional to fun salsas like Mango Cucumber Salsa.

She was the fiction editor of <i>OMNI</i> from 1981&#x2013;1998 and has since edited the online magazines <i>Event Horizon</i> and <i>Sci Fiction</i>. Her many anthologies include <i>Naked City</i>; <i>Snow White, Blood Red</i>; <i>Blood and Other Cravings</i>; and <i>Poe</i>. Datlow has won five Hugo Awards, eight Locus Awards, three Bram Stoker Awards, two Shirley Jackson Awards, and nine World Fantasy Awards.This diverse 25-story anthology is a superb sampling of some of the most significant short horror works published between 1985 and 2005. Editor extraordinaire Datlow (<i>Poe</i>) includes classic stories from horror icons Clive Barker, Peter Straub, and Stephen King as well as SF and fantasy luminaries Gene Wolfe, Dan Simmons, Neil Gaiman, and Lucius Shepard. The full diversity of horror is on display: George R. R. Martin&#x2019;s The Pear-Shaped Man&#x2019; about a creepy downstairs neighbor, and Straub&#x2019;s The Juniper Tree,&#x2019; which chronicles a drifter&#x2019;s sexual molestation of a young boy, exemplify horror&#x2019;s sublime psychological power, while Barker&#x2019;s Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament&#x2019; and Poppy Z. Brite&#x2019;s Calcutta, Lord of Nerves&#x2019; are audaciously gory masterworks.

I give my highest recommendation for this book.&#x201d;<br> <i>Hellnotes.com</i><br><br><b>On <i>Hauntings</i></b><br><br> This anthology of 24 previously published dark fantasy and horror stories, edited by the ever-adept Datlow (<i>Blood and Other Cravings</i>), explores a variety of situations in which people encounter literal or figurative specters from beyond. Some feature the ghosts of lovers or spouses wronged, while others give readers a powerful lens through which to view the evil people can do here on Earth, as in the gut-wrenching Cargo&#x2019; by E. Michael Lewis. The theme is interpreted quite loosely and in varied ways, although many of the stories such as the atmospheric opener, Pat Cadigan&#x2019;s Eenie, Meenie, Ipsateenie,&#x2019; and Adam L. G. Nevill&#x2019;s tense Where Angels Come In&#x2019; hinge on anxieties relating to children in peril. Even so, the collection flows smoothly, capturing the pleasantly shivery dread of a round of ghost stories told by a fire, with only a few hiccups or sour notes (the most sour being Richard Bowes&#x2019;s deeply unpleasant Transfigured Night&#x201d;). Solid entries by Neil Gaiman, Caitl�n R. Kiernan, and Joyce Carol Oates capture the mood perfectly and will thrill fans of the eerie.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> [<i>Hauntings</i> is] apt to entertain and disquiet the horror fans.&#x201d;<br> <i>SF Site, featured review</i><br><br> Datlow once again proves herself as a master editor. Her mission to broaden readers&#x2019; concepts of what a haunting can be is nothing short of a success, and the twenty-four stories on display run the gamut from explicitly terrifying to eerily familiar. Readers who wish to be haunted themselves should not miss this one. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> <i>Arkham Diges</i> <br><br> That delicious sense of tantalization, of maybe and what if, impelled me through page after page, encountering intriguing characters, spine-shivering settings, and bits and pieces (sometimes literally...of corpses)....&#x201d;<br> <i>Hellnotes</i><br><br> A book that must surely be an early contender for any and every Best Anthology award going this year.&#x201d;<br> <i>Black Static</i><br><br> Award-winning horror editor Ellen Datlow offers readers a skillfully crafted, captivating collection with <i>Hauntings</i>, an anthology of twenty-four reprinted ghostly tales from the last 25 years of horror literature.&#x201d;<br> <i>Rue Morgue</i><br><br> Twenty four tales in all spanning the years 1983 through 2012, Ms Datlow has assembled a formidable community of eminent genre artists working at the very heights of their literary powers to create this outstanding dark fantasy anthology.

Golenbock begins with the Giants and the Dodgers and what impact their hijacking had on the city. Baseball finally came to its senses, and the New York Metropolitans came into existence for the 1962 season. One hundred and twenty losses later, the season ended in Chicago with a triple play, a fitting tribute to their still-standing record of futility. The strange thing about the early Mets was that the more they lost, the more the fans loved them. Golenbock combines his own well-researched commentary with the recollections of eyewitnesses. All the personalities are here: Casey Stengel and Marvelous Marv Throneberry, fondly recalled by utility man "Hot" Rod Kanehl, and their first all-star, Ron Hunt. Outfielder Ron Swoboda and pitcher Jerry Koosman reminisce about the Miracle Mets of 1969, while Daryl Strawberry and Keith Hernandez wax nostalgic about the Mets' next World Series win, 17 years later, recalling every crucial play with nail-biting suspense. Strawberry talks candidly about his drug use and his conflicts with teammates and managers, and the author addresses the general dissipation of so many players in the 1980s. Golenbock includes lively testimony not only from ex-players, but sports writers like Robert Lipsyte, the late poet Joel Oppenheimer, front office personnel and regular fans. This is a delightful and painstakingly detailed trip down memory lane that Mets fans will cherish. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Churchill: A life</h2><p>First published in 1991, this is a story of adventure. The author uses Churchill&#39;s personal letters and the recollections of his contemporaries, friends and enemies, to go behind the scenes of some of the stormiest and fascinating political events of our time revealing his qualities in peace and war, not least as an orator and a man of vision.</p><p>It is impossible to understand the Second World War without understanding Winston Churchill, the bold British Prime Minister who showed himself to be one of the greatest statesmen any nation has ever known. This lengthy biography is a single-volume abridgment of a massive, eight-volume work that took a quarter-century to write. It covers Churchill&#39;s entire life, highlighting not only his exploits during the Second World War, but also his early belief in technology and how it would revolutionize warfare in the 20th century. Churchill learned how to fly a plane before the First World War, and was also involved in the development of both the tank and anti-aircraft defense. But he truly showed his unmatched mettle during his country&#39;s darkest moments: &#34;His finest hour was the leadership of Britain when it was most isolated, most threatened, and most weak; when his own courage, determination, and belief in democracy became at one with the nation,&#34; writes Gilbert. There are several wonderful books available on Churchill, but this is probably the best place to start.Martin Gilbert&#39;s highly-acclaimed &#34;Churchill: A Life is a story of adventure. It follows Winston Churchill from his earliest days to his moments of triumph. Here, the drama and excitement of his story are ever-present, as are his tremendous qualities in peace and war, not least as an orator and as a man of vision. Gilbert gives us a vivid portrait, using Churchill&#39;s most personal letters and the recollections of his contemporaries, both friends and enemies, to go behind the scenes of some of the stormiest and most fascinating political events of our time, dominated by two world wars and culminating in the era of the Iron Curtain.</p><h2>Job Practice Manual for Modern Masonry: Brick, Block, Stone</h2><p>Simply and clearly written, Modern Masonry presents students with a thorough grounding in safe methods of laying brick, block, and stone.

Large, dynamic flows of power, people, and culture that merge, thrive, then break apart - the pieces only to merge again in a new configuration, the process to be repeated. Through pictures and words, &#34;Empires: Their Rise and Fall&#34; brings the reader face to face with many of the world&#39;s greatest empires. Full-color photographs are combined with an absorbing narrative in a lively historical account of each empire and an examination of the period&#39;s most enduring cultural achievements. This volume in the series focuses on Ancient Egypt, and Alexander and the World of Hellenism. In light of the barbarism that has existed over the history of civilized man, it is remarkable how much of ancient societies remains. For the earliest civilizations, our knowledge begins with scanty, often mythological, lists of kings. In the temples of ancient Egypt, the prowess of the king is dramatized in battle, in receiving tributes of the vanquished, and in other ennobling pursuits that glorify his reign. The greater part of the scenes and texts represented in the temples, however, illustrates and describes the rituals performed by the king for the gods. Although the Egyptian kings are identified by name, their personalities rarely rise above their activities. Yet beneath the impression of cold anonymity, glimpses of individuals do, on occasion, emerge. In contrast, the literature and documents of Hellenistic society reveal a more complex society. The polyglot atmosphere of the cosmopolis not only gave rise to many tensions, but also fostered an environment that must have been both lively and stimulating. So it was that the new Macedonian dynasties in Greece, Syria, and Mesopotamia by slow degrees transformed the Western world, creating the new order of Hellenism. The legacies of Greece, Palestine and the Levant, Mesopotamia, and Egypt were incorporated into this new order.</p><p></p><h2>The Last of the Mohicans</h2><p><p>James Fenimore Cooper places the two beautiful Munro sisters in the midst of the the savagery of life on the frontier, dominated by feuding Indian tribes and the relentless European encroachment on the Native American lifestyle. &nbsp;Cooper&#x2019;s spine-tingling perennial best-seller is an essential part of American culture.

I have waged a fierce internal struggle over whether to share my story&#x2014;the devil on one shoulder saying it would only serve to humiliate me, the angel on the other saying it might help others. If you&#x2019;re reading this, the angel won&#x2014;though not without a few cuts and bruises.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s not to say you will like me. You won&#x2019;t. Some of you will hate me. I don&#x2019;t blame you. I have spent a fair amount of time hating myself. But I ask that you might extend me just enough grace to hear my story. Not so I can excuse what I&#x2019;ve done&#x2014;there is no excuse for what I&#x2019;ve done&#x2014;but so you can see how even someone as lost as I was can find himself. Who knows? Maybe it will help you with your struggles. Maybe it will even help you find a little grace for yourself.<br> <br>You might assume that my journey started the day I died to the world. But it started long before that. The day of my death, Tuesday, May 3, was just the day the tracks switched beneath my life. I&#x2019;ll begin my story a week or so before.<br> <br><br> <br>It was a rainy evening in St. Louis, Missouri. I was doing what I do&#x2014;preaching the gospel of wealth to an auditorium of hopefuls and believers. There were about twelve hundred people in the audience that night, each attendee bought and paid for through advertising. There was a science to the numbers and a price placed on each attendee&#x2014;$327 for each butt in a chair.<br> <br>I took a last swig from a can of energy drink as the announcer boomed, &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you&#x2019;ve been waiting for, the man of the hour, the direct descendant of the legendary outlaw Jesse James, the incomparable . . . Charles James!&#x201d;<br> <br>Music blared as I walked out from behind the curtain, both of my hands raised triumphantly in the air. Somewhat appropriately, my theme song was Tears for Fears&#x2019; &#x201c;Everybody Wants to Rule the World.&#x201d;<br> <br>I walked to the center of the stage as the crowd roared. I snatched the microphone from its stand and just stood there, looking out over the cheering audience for more than a minute, waiting for the applause to settle. When I sensed it was starting to slow, I raised my hand. &#x201c;Thank you. Thank you, you&#x2019;re very kind. That&#x2019;s enough. Now calm down. Time&#x2019;s important. We&#x2019;ve got things to talk about. Important things. Vital things.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the crowd had hushed, I said, &#x201c;Henry David Thoreau wrote, &#x2018;The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.&#x2019; There is one great truth in life that will determine whether your life is one of success or one of quiet desperation.&#x201d; I stabbed at the air with my index finger. &#x201c;Just one. Do you want to know that truth?&#x201d;<br> <br>I paused for their response. After more than seven hundred presentations I already knew how they&#x2019;d respond. I always did. I saw some heads nodding. Then a few brave souls shouted, &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tell us!&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at the audience in feigned disappointment, tapping the microphone against my chin. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not promising. I saaaid&#x201d;&#x2014;holding the word like a television evangelist&#x2014;&#x201c;do you want to hear that truth? Because I&#x2019;m not casting pearls before a bunch of swine. Not here. Not now. Not ever. In fact, will all swine please leave the hall right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not surprisingly, no one stood. Someone in the crowd shouted, &#x201c;Sooey!&#x201d; Everyone laughed.<br> <br>Perfect. I looked the crowd over until they again quieted. Then, speaking in a softer voice than before, again asked, &#x201c;Do you want to hear the one great truth?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; came the resounding response. &#x201c;Tell us!&#x201d;<br> <br>I took a deep breath, feigning disappointment. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s all the passion you can muster for the one great truth of life, you might as well leave right now. In fact, you might as well just die right now, because your life is going nowhere.&#x201d; I looked at them for another thirty seconds for effect, creating a strained atmosphere in the room. Then I said, &#x201c;All right, let&#x2019;s do this one more time. Last chance. I want to hear winners, not whiners. Do. You. Want. To. Know. The. One. Great. Truth. Yes or no?&#x201d;<br> <br>The chorus was deafening. &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right then,&#x201d; I said, lowering my hand. &#x201c;All right. I knew you could do it. Now you&#x2019;re sounding like winners.&#x201d; I walked to the edge of the stage, looking into the eyes of those in the front row. &#x201c;This is it. Listen very carefully.&#x201d; I knelt down on one knee and softened my voice. &#x201c;This is the one great truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>The room fell dead quiet. You could hear a credit card drop.<br> <br>&#x201c;In life, you are either the butcher or the sheep. There is no in-between.&#x201d;<br> <br>I waited a moment, and then stood. &#x201c;You are either the butcher or the sheep!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;Which are you? Am I talking to a room full of sheep?&#x201d; I looked out over the audience. &#x201c;Anyone who is a sheep, stand up and walk out right now. I don&#x2019;t waste my time with swine and sheep. If you&#x2019;re not strong enough, if you don&#x2019;t care enough about your life enough to choose to be an apex predator, to be a warrior, then go right ahead and join the millions of sheep outside this convention center. There&#x2019;s always room in their flock. Go ahead, I&#x2019;m waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, predictably, no one stood. They never did.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right then. You want to be predators. You want to be lions. That&#x2019;s good. But even lions must be taught how to kill. They must be prepared and tested. But lions have an advantage over you. They are raised to be lions. You, on the other hand, were raised, by society, to be sheep. To be timid and weak. Not your fault. Society fears lions. A world of lions is impossible to control. Impossible to slaughter. While a world of sheep is easy to lead, easy to butcher. Many of you came here today as sheep. The good news, if you have the courage to choose to win, is that you will leave as lions.<br> <br>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m talking about is change. Deep, personal change.&#x201d; I pounded my abs. &#x201c;Core change. And change is coming whether you like it or not. Sometimes you can feel it, the way old people can feel changing weather in their joints. Change is always coming. Nothing is more unchanging than change, just as nothing is more certain than uncertainty.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked out over the audience, their faces barely visible in the dark, as the hall&#x2019;s spotlights were all on me. &#x201c;Look around you. The wave is coming. Not just any wave, but a tsunami. Will you ride it, or will it rush over you, drown you?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>It was the perfect segue into my near-death story. Every presenter I knew had a good &#x201c;brush with death&#x201d; experience, even if they had to make one up. I didn&#x2019;t. I just embellished it.<br> <br>Nine months earlier, my now ex-girlfriend and I had spent the day at Flamands Beach in St. Barths, an immaculate white-sand beach where beautiful people sunned beneath skies as clear as the turquoise water while white-clad beach servants ran from chair to chair taking drink orders.<br> <br>I had swum and bodysurfed for several hours and was just about to head in to shore when I saw a large wave coming. I swam into it, catching the crest. I soon discovered that I hadn&#x2019;t caught the wave, rather it had caught me. I felt myself tumbling through the water like a sock in a dryer. My tumbling came to an abrupt stop as I hit ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was a loud snap,&#x201d; I told the crowd. &#x201c;As sharp as a breaking tree branch. My first thought was that I had broken my neck. It&#x2019;s remarkable how quickly your thoughts run in crisis. This is how you die, I thought. Right here, right now, underwater, unseen. I imagined my lifeless body washing up on shore.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was angry. Death wasn&#x2019;t on my to-do list when I got up that morning. It never is. But I was still alive, and I knew I had a choice. I knew I was broken, but I still had a choice. I could give up or I could live.<br> <br>&#x201c;At that moment, I decided to live. In spite of the pain, in spite of my body being in shock, I began clawing my way toward shore. It was only when I had got my body halfway out of the water that I passed out.<br> <br>&#x201c;I woke in an ambulance. They drove me to a small medical clinic where no one spoke English. I had crushed my scapula and broken all of my ribs. I was bandaged up and given nothing but Tylenol for the pain. That night, I flew back to Chicago and the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. I&#x2019;ll never forget the doctor walking into my room carrying my X-rays.<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;You shouldn&#x2019;t be alive,&#x2019; he told me. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s the worst break I&#x2019;ve seen on anyone still breathing.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>The audience listened intensely. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the story wasn&#x2019;t true. At least, not completely. I had been bodysurfing in St. Barths when I broke my arm. But that was it. The truth didn&#x2019;t matter, just the story.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re either living or you&#x2019;re dying,&#x201d; I said softly. &#x201c;So what is it? The financial waves of life are drowning you. Every time you think you might get ahead, they pound you down again and again. Will you live or will you die? That&#x2019;s a question only you can answer right now.&#x201d; I took a deep breath and said, &#x201c;For the survivors in this room, for those who choose to be warriors and apex predators, for those who choose to live, I&#x2019;m going to teach you how to ride those waves. I&#x2019;m not just talking about treading water, I&#x2019;m talking about surfing those babies onto white-sand beaches. I&#x2019;m going to teach you how to make money in your sleep. Who is with me? Where are my lions?&#x201d;<br> <br>The crowd roared. A half hour later people lined up with their credit cards, checkbooks, and hope.</p><h2>LEGO NEXO KNIGHTS Character Encyclopedia</h2><p><p>With an exclusive Clay minifigure and an exclusive NEXO Power, this comprehensive guide showcases all the minifigures, vehicles, and NEXO Powers in the LEGO� NEXO KNIGHTS&#x2122; kingdom.</p><p>LEGO NEXO KNIGHTS: <i>Character Encyclopedia</i> features all the popular characters from the LEGO NEXO KNIGHTS toys, games and television show.

And never more so than now for, although she was surrounded by relatives who depended on her, whom she loved and who must surely love her, there was no doubt in her mind that somebody was trying to kill her.Threatening letters could be ignored, odd tasting chocolates can be rejected but when snakes are left in her bed, Rachel is convinced that someone means here terrible harm. Her only chance of a future life lay with Miss Silver, and Miss Silver was well on the way to unmasking the murderer when they struck again.</p><p>Patricia Wentworth (1878 1961) was one of the masters of classic English mystery writing. Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.<br>Diana Bishop is an AudioFile Earphones Award-winning narrator who has worked extensively in theater, including seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company and also for the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Council. She has twice been a member of the BBC's Radio Drama Company and has made many television appearances. She is also a prizewinning poet and a writer of short stories and plays for theater and radio.Fans of cozy mysteries, rejoice! Another Patricia Wentworth title is available in audio. When Rachel Treherne begins to suspect that one of her grasping relatives has designs on her life, she prevails upon shrewd Miss Silver to visit her country home. Diana Bishop portrays the kind but no-nonsense manner of the governess turned private detective. Bishop adopts a slightly softer tone when Miss Silver chooses (like Miss Marple) to act the part of an ineffectual old lady. Other female characters are also amusingly depicted, including Rachel&#39;s peevish &#34;invalid&#34; sister, her malicious niece, and her passionately protective servant. A couple of suspenseful passages and a few chilling moments round out the story.

Jacket is chipped along bottom with tears around top. Dented across bottom board edge. This is a non-word, pictorial story. Very nice. Beautifully illustrated with story panels. Unpaginated. [Children&#39;s Literature]</p><p>Who needs words to tell a story? In Raymond Briggs's charming tale, told with 175 softly hued, artfully composed frames, a little boy makes friends with a snowman. He wakes up on a snowy day, tells his mother he's going outside, then begins a flurry of snowman-building. That night, he can't sleep, so he opens the front door and lo! the snowman has come to life. The amiable yet frosty fellow enjoys his tour of the boy's cozy home; he admires the cat, but is disturbed by the fire. The boy shows him other wonders--the TV and a lamp and running water. Predictably perhaps, he is disturbed by the stove, but likes ice cubes quite a bit. Soon it is the snowman's turn to introduce the boy to <i>his</i> wintry world. They join hands, rise up into the blizzardy air--presumably over Russia and into the Middle East--and then safely back to home sweet home. The boy pops into bed before his parents get up... but when he wakes up the next morning he races outside only to find his new buddy's melted remains, scattered with a few forlorn lumps of coal. Since the book is wordless, you can make up any ending you want... like "Then, in a puff of pink smoke, the snowman recomposed himself and went to live in the boy's garage freezer." Or you could just resign yourself to a peaceful "And that was that."

Toward this end, &#34;The Myths That Divide Us&#34; stands as a most important boo on the subject of America&#39;s enduring national dilemma -- race. This treatise offers -- in a clear, logical, and intrepid manner -- powerful evidence that the most serious social and economic problems afflicting black Americans are not due to societal racism, but rather to the tragic disintegration of the black family. By taking this position (which the author supports with hundreds of references to vital sociological, historical, and contemporary research), Perazzo&#39;s work differs markedly from the vast majority of books on race. While noting that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. declared as early as 1965 that the civil rights movement had already achieved its principal goals, Perazzo asserts that King&#39;s successors have nonetheless done everything in their power to keep alive the false perception that American society mistreats the black community in a host of ways, both overtly and covertly. &#34;They contemptibly use their personal agendas to keep fueling the fire of racial enmity,&#34; he says. Perazzo contends that civil rights crusaders evaluate matters of race by two sets of standards. For instance, one chapter of his book discusses how these leaders relentlessly drew worldwide attention to the evils of South African apartheid during the 1980s, yet have said virtually nothing about the far greater atrocities perpetrated against black victims all over the African continent. Another chapter details how civil rights leaders have loudly denounced the white enslavement of blacks that occurred in a bygone age (and have gone so far as to demand that reparations be paid collectively to present-day blacks), yet they have remained silent about the black-on-black slavery that pervaded Africa since time immemorial. Indeed, these leaders refuse even to denounce the modern-day slavery that currently exists in some African nations. Closer to home, Perazzo demonstrates such major points as these: -- Notwithstanding civil rights agitators&#39; irresponsible charges to the contrary, white racism in the United States has declined dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, to the point where the black Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has said that America &#34;is now the least racist white-majority society in the world.&#34; -- Contrary to popular belief, the American criminal-justice system treats black defendants no more harshly than white defendants. -- Affirmative action has heightened racial tensions while doing almost nothing to improve the economic condition of black Americans, and is merely a variation of similar failed policies elsewhere in the world. Perazzo further details research which shows that: -- Fatherlessness, not race, is the most accurate predictor thaty a child will end up in poverty or in prison. -- Black full-time workers today earn slightly more than white workers of the same age, sex, and IQ. -- College-educated, black working couples earn more than similar white couples in every age group and in every region of the country. This book does not tread lightly in its assessment of those individuals currently recognized as the foremost civil rights leaders in the United States. It exposes them, without apology or euphemism, as charlatans who prefer to sermonize rather than educate; who deliver hackneyed platitudes rather than knowledge; and who substitute elaborate exhibitions of moral preening, for reason.</p><p>Twenty-four centuries ago, when the Greek playwright Euripides wrote that "cleverness is not wisdom," he scarcely could have foreseen the lamentable degree to which the greater part of mankind would fail to grasp such a simple yet profound truth. Indeed, our contemporary society is filled with individuals who exalt cleverness far above wisdom, and for whom a lie told convincingly makes a satisfactory substitute for truth. Dazzling us with their verbal maneuvering, they waltz away from reality with carefully worded ambiguities and evasions. Effortlessly they twist their faces into pained and pious countenances -- thereby giving the appearance of passion and sincerity. And when their orations have ended, media pundits and academics expertly analyze their "performance," as if to imply that deception is a skill which, when practiced artfully, is in itself worthy of admiration. Politicians traditionally have been the most visible of these deceivers. Less scrutinized have been the mainstays of the modern-day "civil rights" establishment who, under the guise of promoting "brotherhood," have made an art form of fomenting interracial enmity. <p>This book does not tread lightly in its assessment of those individuals currently recognized as the foremost civil-rights leaders in the United States. It exposes them, without apology or euphemism, as charlatans who choose to sermonize rather than educate; who deliver hollow platitudes rather than knowledge; and who substitute elaborate exhibitions of moral preening for reason. With incessant fervor, they mischaracterize our country as a racist wasteland wherein African Americans are doomed to misery and failure under the yoke of white bigotry. Upon these pages are their lies exposed. Herein is the sorrowful story of the millions whose lives they have ruined and whose souls they have corrupted. Ultimately, the purpose of this book is to demonstrate that under the light of reason, the elaborate myths of these demagogues silently melt away like ice sculptures in the sun.</p>TP</p><h2>In the spring of 2017 Martin Roth published a selection of his works</h2><p><i>In the spring of 2017 Martin Roth published a selection of his works</i> presents the work of Austrian artist Martin Roth, whose practice moves across painting, sculpture, installation, video and interventions, working primarily with animals and plants.<br><br>Martin Roth works between the boundaries of nature and art, combining the two worlds in unique ways and questioning the gap between humans and the natural world. In recent projects he has created a soundscape for a bonsai tree using amplified sounds of caged birds, frogs, fish and crickets; grown tufts of grass on Persian rugs; and populated a gallery with parakeets living in debris from the Syrian-Turkish border. Taken as a whole, his work examines how the introduction of an organic element can redefine a surface, an object or its relation to the surrounding space. His work can be large-scale and particular to a site. The fact that it requires the nurture of living organisms makes it strangely intimate and invites the viewer if not to engage directly, at least to consider his or her relationship to the work on a human scale.<br><br>Martin Roth is an artist living in New York City.

We learn about that first summer of 1929, filled with heated debates that went on long into the night, sexual rivalry and betrayal, and the dangerous ideas that led people to experiment with new ways of behaving. We hear how Sartre compromised with the Nazis and fell into a Soviet honey-trap. And, thanks to recently discovered letters written by the avowed feminist DeBeauvoir, Seymour-Jones reveals the darker, more dangerous side to the couple&#39;s philosophy of free love, including Simone&#39;s lesbianism and her pimping of younger girls for Jean-Paul in order to keep his love. Finally available in the U.S., this is a compelling and fascinating account of what lay behind the legend that this brilliant, tempestuous couple created.</p><p>Carole Seymour-Jones was born in North Wales and educated at Oxford and Sussex Universities. Her recent biography <i> Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot </i> was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize. She is the chair of the Writers in Prison Committee of English PEN, and co-editor of <i> Another Sky: Voices of Conscience from Around the World</i>, a collection of pieces by writers imprisoned for expressing their views.In this sensationalist account of the unconventional private and public lives of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Seymour-Jones (<i>Painted Shadow</i>) offers Sartre's incestuous relationship with his mother as a psychosexual backdrop to his adult life as Beauvoir's lover. While generally more sympathetic to Beauvoir, the author presents her with distaste as an exploitative manipulator, a paedophile with a predilection for girl-on-girl action who busied herself procuring young women for Sartre's harem. Woven through these accounts of sexual exploits is the story of their intellectual development, the genesis of their writings and their deeply problematic relationship to Marxism and the Soviet Union. However, all too often, we are returned to cheap psychologizing (murder was in Beavoir's heart) and prurient detail. With frequently unreferenced quotes and claims, the book offers little more than insinuation, eschewing clear evidence and demonstration in favor of conflating the lives of the writers with their fictional characters. Any value such a biography might have as a revisionist antidote to its subjects' own hagiographic tendencies is fatally undermined by the author's questionable use of source material, judgmental tone and preference for cheap effects. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And so the middle-aged spinster with a penchant for romance takes off on one of the ponderous stage coaches known as Flying Machines. Predictably, the coach and its mad mix of occupants has a mishap, forcing the passengers to put up at an inn that becomes snowbound.

Like some of Chesney's spinsters in earlier series, Hannah Pym is not above an amusing deviousness, which brings about the happy endings in this unstartling, light entertainment. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ella Minnow Pea</h2><p><p>Ella Minnow Pea is an epistolary novel set in the fictional island of Nollop situated off the coast of South Carolina and home to the inventor the pangram The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog. Now deceased, the islanders have erected a monument to honor their hero, but one day a tile with the letter �&#x201c;z�&#x201d; falls from the statue. The leaders interpret the falling tile as a message from beyond the grave and the letter is banned from use. On an island where the residents pride themselves on their love of language, this is seen as a tragedy. They are still reeling from the shock, when another tile falls and then another.... Mark Dunn takes us on a journey against time through the eyes of Ella Minnow Pea and her family as they race to find another phrase containing all the letters of the alphabet to save them from being unable to communicate.

Ella Minnow Pea is his first novel.</p>.... On Wednesday, July 19, the Council, having gleaned and discerned, released its official verdict: the fall of the tile bearing the letter &#x201c;z&#x201d; constitutes the terrestrial manifestation of an empyrean Nollopian desire, that most surely being that the letter &#x201c;z&#x201d; should be utterly excised &#x2014; fully extirpated &#x2014; absolutively heave-ho&#x2019;ed from our communal vocabulary! Henceforth, use of the arguably superfluous twenty-sixth letter will be outlawed from all island speech and graphy. Mr. Nollop, who knows best the needs of the island which he claimed as home after years of peripatetic travel through the world of language and linguistics, has issued a directive to the people of this nation&#x2014;has sat fully upright upon his bier, as it were, and&#x2014;continuing to guide our lives and social intercourse through undying interest in and love of the islanders who drew him and his brilliance to their collective bosom- has issued this challenge direct from his very grave: we are heretofore to communicate using only the twenty-five letters that remain. <p> And we, as his grateful servants (serving the memory of his greatness) have been called by High Council to obey. Under penalties to be determined by the aforementioned Council. </p><p> On Friday, July 21, those penalties were decided. They are as follows: to speak or write any word containing the letter &#x201c;z&#x201d;, or to be found in possession of any written communication containing this letter, one will receive for a first offense, a public oral reprimand either by a member of the island Law Enforcement Brigade (known with trembling affection as the L.E.B.) or by a member of its civilian auxiliary. Second offenders will be offered choice between corporal pain of body-flogging and the public humiliation of headstock upon the public square (or in your case, the village commons). For third offense, violators will be banished from the island. Refusal to leave upon order of Council will result in death.

The Americans besieged in the fort on the Canadian side of the Niagara River succeeded in driving off the British attacks but decided to withdraw across the border before the onset of winter, thus marking the end of hostilities on Canadian soil.<br><br> The second major action is the naval and land battle of Plattsburgh, New York. An outgunned American naval squadron on Lake Champlain succeeded through outstanding seamanship in defeating their Royal Navy opponents, causing the British commander in chief, General Sir George Prevost, to withdraw, a reverse he was unable to live down and an American victory that had a direct bearing on the final outcome of the war.<br><br> The author also describes the devastating raid in which General Duncan McArthur&#x2019;s mounted troops burned and plundered their way across southwestern Ontario from present-day Windsor to Brantford<br><br> Written by Donald E.

Each spread features a number from one to ten, and each illustration embodies bountiful examples of that number, if only you can spot them all! An instant classic in Australia when it was first published in 1978, this one-of-a-kind counting book continues to enchant.</p><p><b>Peter Pavey</b>, the creator of many innovative picture books, took three years to complete the intricate&nbsp;<i>One Dragon&#x2019;s Dream</i>. He lives in Australia.Grade 2&#x2013;3&#x2014;One dragon falls asleep under his green-checked blanket and dreams of two turkeys that tease him. The odd dream continues, and an ever-increasing number of animals (three tigers, four frogs, and so on) torment the poor dragon in some way. Eventually, the hapless creature is brought into court, sentenced, and "juggled off to jail" by seven slippery sea lions. In the end, he is rescued and "towed home to bed" by a "team of ten turtles." The dragon wakes safe and sound under his cozy blanket. The spare text is enhanced by the author's imaginatively frenetic ink and watercolor illustrations. Each spread is a puzzle of random objects to be counted. As five kangaroos fence in the dragon, children can also search for five owls, five dogs, five buttons, and a plethora of other items grouped in fives on the page. Much of the imagery evokes the magical age of knights and dragons. This book is not as kid-friendly as Leo and Diane Dillon's cheerful <i>Mother Goose Numbers on the Loose</i> (Harcourt, 2007), but older readers may appreciate this surreal counting book's sophisticated themes and elaborate illustrations.&#x2014;<i>Linda L.

He lives in Provo, Utah, with his wife, Ann, and their five children. </p>PreSchool-This story actually begins on the endpapers, long before breakfast. Father Rabbit and one of his bunnies are winding up a clock in the evening. The following pages show Mother Rabbit, early in the morning, enjoying what readers will discover is a rare moment of peace. Soon she wakes her five youngsters and the day begins. During the next 12 hours, the parents shepherd their bunnies through their daily routines and activities. Each spread is filled with humor and detail, and children will want to pore over the pictures. The inclusion of the hour of the day in each accompanying four-line stanza is casual and unforced. In fact, the rhythmic text doesn't miss a beat. In each illustration, a clock corresponding to the hour mentioned in the verse is depicted quite naturally-for example, a child playing with a pocket watch at lunch or a garden clock mounted on a wall. The tale comes full circle in the final scene with the parents relaxing with a cup of tea at the end of the eventful day.

Doody, photographic services manager at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, capture the special appeal of Williamsburg in every season of the year. Focusing on the cycle of the seasons, Doody photographed the glory of springtime blossoms and flowering trees, the agricultural tasks to be accomplished in the heat of a Tidewater summertime, the heightened pace that autumn brings, and the tranquility of soft, white, wintertime snows. Williamsburg: A Seasonal Sampler ends with the excitement of Christmas in the capital of colonial Virginia. The text is by historian Thad W. Tate, who wites that -the seasons of the year, with their many variations in climate and appearance of the landscape, have always played a significant, even indispensable, role in people&#39;s lives. For colonial Virginians, the cycle of the seasons continued to shape much in their daily lives -their work, their recreation, and even their conduct of public affairs -around the differing conditions each season imposed. According to Tate, -The striking photographs that are the principal feature of this volume provide evidence that our forebears, too, had developed a keen appreciation of the ever-changing beauty of the seasons.</p><p>Dave Doody produces much of the photography for books and other materials published by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. He was the principal photographer for the 1607: Jamestown and the New World; Link to the Past, Bridge to the Future: Colonial Williamsburg&#39;s Animals; and The Gardens of Colonial Williamsburg among many others.

From a daughter&#39;s first dance to a lobbyist&#39;s first jail sentence and a cicada&#39;s first date (after waiting underground for 17 years, one gets anxious), Spivey captures the times with his well-honed talent for finding the funny. Spivey&#39;s book celebrates the uniquely American system of democracy that protects our God-given right to, year after year, do the dumbest things, and the author doesn&#39;t miss a one. In these troubled times, laughter is the best medicine, and A Hamster Is Missing in Washington, D.C. is just the prescription you need, unless you have an infection, in which case you&#39;ll also need an antibiotic.</p><p>For more than two decades, Ed Spivey Jr. has consistently won top honors in humor writing from the nation&#39;s religious and independent press associations.

Some go on retreats but are often disappointed. Many thoughtful, educated people search for spiritual guidance in Eastern religious traditions, unaware of the great riches within their own heritage. Dorothy Bass and the other contributors to this multi-denominational collection show how they can shape a faithful way of life during challenging times at work, at home, and in the community. This book explores the stuff of everyday life, placing ordinary activities in a biblical and historical context, and discovering in them opportunities to realize God's active presence in life.<br> <br> Practices include:<br> * Honoring the body <br> * Hospitality <br> * Household economics <br> * Saying yes and saying no<br> * Keeping Sabbath<br> * Testimony<br> * Discernment<br> * Shaping Communities<br> * Forgiveness<br> * Healing</p><p>The gap between theory and practice in religion is one of growing consternation for people. Aside from going to church on Sunday, how does a Christian manifest the power of this religion in his or her own life? Instead of just <i>being</i> a Christian, how can one bring the meaningfulness of Christianity into one's life? Dorothy C. Bass and 12 other Christian leaders offer concrete practices such as hospitality, simplicity, and community gathering that serve to enrich our lives and the lives of others while reinforcing faith in God. Although presented from a Christian point of view, the practices themselves are universally applicable.Many Christians are looking for ways to deepen their relationship with God by practicing their faith in everyday life. Some go on retreats but are often disappointed to find that the integrated life they experienced in a place apart is difficult to recreate in their day-to-day world. Many thoughtful, educated Christians search for spiritual guidance in Eastern religious traditions, unaware of the great riches within their own heritage. To all these seekers, Practicing Our Faith offers help that is rooted in Christian faith and tradition. Refusing to leave our beliefs in the realm of theory, this book explores twelve central Christian practices &#x2014; shared activities that address fundamental human needs and that, woven together, form a way of life. The contributors explore in depth each practice &#x2014; such as keeping Sabbath, honoring the body, and forgiving one another &#x2014; by placing it in its historical and biblical context, reexamining its relevance to our times, and showing how it gives depth and meaning to daily life. Shaped by the Christian community over the centuries yet richly grounded in the experiences of living communities today, these practices show us how Christian spiritual disciplines can become an integral part of how we live each day. The book's thirteen contributors, who come from diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds, draw on their rich shared experience as believers, theologians, ethicists, and educators. Informed by the wisdom of the Christian tradition yet alert to the needs of our time, they illustrate how we can conduct our daily lives in concert with all creation and in communion with God. The Practices: <ul> <li>Honoring the body</li> <li>Hospitality</li> <li>Household economics</li> <li>Saying yes and saying no</li> <li>Keeping Sabbath</li> <li>Testimony</li> <li>Discernment</li> <li>Shaping communities</li> <li>Forgiveness</li> <li>Healing</li> <li>Dying well</li> <li>Singing our lives</li> </ul></p><h2>Christianity in the Light of Science: Critically Examining the World&#39;s Largest Religion</h2><p>This anthology of new critical essays written by experts in their fields, in honor of the late Victor Stenger, examines Christianity using established scientific criteria. Where science specifically touches upon the claims of Christianity the authors seek to show those claims lack the required evidence. The result is that Christianity is not a sufficiently evidenced religion. In his New York Times bestseller, God: The Failed Hypothesis, physicist Victor Stenger argued that claims of religion should be subject to the same standards of scientific rigor as any other truth claim. Taking this approach, the contributors argue that Christianity fails every known scientific test for truth. Stenger himself wrote a chapter for this volume before he died.In it he presents a brief history of ideas about cosmology, showing that Christianity&#39;s premodern understanding of the cosmos is incompatible with current scientific evidence regarding the origin and structure of the cosmos. Other contributors examine a wide variety of topics, including biblical archaeology, Intelligent Design, the Shroud of Turin, free will, the existence of the soul, the efficacy of petitionary prayer, and more.This challenging work is indispensable reading for both skeptical readers and open-minded people of faith.</p><p><b>John W.

At the foundation of their healing, he discovered, was the concept of the straight path, a journey through life whose truth is revealed only to the extent that it is searched for with honesty and faith. It is a way of healing that in its very essence is a way of living, a path that emphasizes the spiritual dimensions of health and the relevance of these to the community. But while interviewing healers at work, Katz was drawn into an increasingly suspenseful drama. Unexplained deaths, rumors and suspicions, and the intrusion of a zealous evangelist rocked the village and soon revealed to the author the dangerous alternative to the straight path: the misuse of power that some call witchcraft. <br> <br><i>The Straight Path of the Spirit</i> is an engrossing story of indigenous healers and a dramatic account of cultures in collision. Through the story of his own self-transformation, Katz reveals not only those aspects of life essential for the Fijians as they struggle to hold onto their identity, but also what is of importance to all of us who seek to retain our humanity.</p><p>Richard Katz, Ph.D., has worked with traditional healing systems throughout the world. After teaching at Harvard for nearly twenty years, Katz is now a professor at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

At the foundation of their healing, he discovered, was the concept of the <em>straight path</em>, a journey through life whose truth is revealed only to the extent that it is searched for with honesty and faith. The straight path emphasizes the spiritual dimension of health and the ceremonial use of kava, known to the Fijians as <em>yaqona</em>. But while apprenticing himself to healers, Katz was drawn into an increasingly suspenseful drama. Unexplained deaths, rumors and suspicions, and the intrusion of a zealous evangelist rocked the village and revealed the dangerous alternative to the straight path: the misuse of power that some call witchcraft. <br> <br>As well as being the only in-depth study of the healing and spiritual aspects of kava in its original cultural context, <em>The Straight Path of the Spirit</em> is an engrossing story of indigenous healers and a dramatic account of cultures in collision. Through the story of his own self-transformation, Katz reveals not only those aspects of life essential for the Fijians as they struggle to maintain their identity, but also what is of importance to all of us who seek to retain our humanity. <br> <br>RICHARD KATZ, Ph.D., has worked with traditional healing systems throughout the world. After teaching at Harvard for nearly twenty years, Katz is now a professor at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

They are good luck charms and amulets to some, portents of doom to others. They inspire everything from lip gloss flavors to amusement parks (Knott&#x2019;s Berry Farm, anyone?)&#x2014;but eat some varieties and your days will be numbered. We create special bowls and spoons for their presentation and consumption, and without them, there would be no Neapolitan ice cream, and jam would be nothing but a marmalade (though oranges are technically berries, too). However diminutive their stature, berries are of such significance to Northern and Eastern Europeans that picking them in the wild is deemed &#x201c;everyman&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; an act interwoven with cultural identity.<br><br> In <i>Berries</i>, Heather Arndt Anderson uncovers the offbeat stories of how humans came to love these tiny, bewildering fruits. Readers meet the inventor of thornless brambles; learn ancient fables and berry-lore; discover berries&#x2019; uses in both poisonous witches&#x2019; brews and modern superfood health crazes. Featuring a selection of historic and original recipes for berry lovers to try, this is a witty and lushly illustrated ramble through the curious history of our favorite fruits, from interlopers like strawberries (<i>not</i> true berries) to the real deal: tomatoes.</p><p><b>Heather Arndt Anderson </b>is a Portland, Oregon&#x2013;based food writer, culinary historian, and botanist, as well as a regular panelist on the podcast <i>The Four Top</i>.

Here everyone consumes daily grams of soma, to fight depression, babies are born in laboratories, and the most popular form of entertainment is a &#34;Feelie,&#34; a movie that stimulates the senses of sight, hearing, and touch. Though there is no violence and everyone is provided for, Bernard Marx feels something is missing and senses his relationship with a young women has the potential to be much more than the confines of their existence allow.

The walls are paneled in a pale oak veneer. Oak forests covered much of northern Israel until the Ottoman Turks, who ruled the Middle East until 1914, built railroads that crisscrossed the Holy Land and fueled them with what was at hand. As a result, the number of old-growth oaks in modern-day Israel might be counted in the hundreds. Occasionally, solitary trees can be found like sentient monuments among the pine and fir of the reforested hills around Jerusalem. The oak panels in the courtroom are from Sweden.<br> <br>Dahlia Barr, at forty-four a stark beauty whose face, long drained of softness, retains the glow of resilience, stands with the prosecutor before the judges. Her hair is the color of the oak veneer, shot with streaks of dramatic gray that pick up the color of her eyes.

Modern science and classic spiritual traditions agree: regulating the breath leads to radiance and wellness in the body, mind, and spirit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> The Tibetan Yoga of Breath</i> pairs the teachings of Tibetan Yantra Yoga (breathing yoga) with select contemplative ideas and practices and examines how well they complement each other through the lens of Western medical science. The benefits of proper breathing are offered from the point of view of classical Indian/Tibetan practice, and contemporary medical research supports how breath cultivates physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Basic Yantra Yoga techniques--also called wind energy training--are the key practices for achieving this vitality, down to the cellular level.</p><p>ANYEN RINPOCHE is a tulku from Tibet of the Nyingma (Longchen Nyingthig) tradition. He lives primarily in Denver, Colorado, where he founded Orgyen Khamdroling Center with a shedra (college) for Westerners.

She has either translated or collaborated with Rinpoche on all of his books. She lives in Denver, Colorado.Excerpt from the introduction: "As I prepared to write this book with Anyen Rinpoche, I delved into the medical research that has been done on the subject of the breath and the health benefits of bringing the proper amount of oxygen into the blood, with the assistance of my Vajra Sister Sarah Teague Johnson. I was amazed at how the yogis of India and Tibet, with no access to modern technology or research instruments, gained a thorough knowledge of the effect of the breath, proper and improper, on our physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Not only did these classic masters understand the problems caused by improper breathing in a way that perfectly corresponds to modern medical science, but they also knew how to remedy these problems with very simple techniques. These breathing 'treatments' and 'cures' are as easy as working with posture, nasal breathing, and the elongation of the inhalation and exhalation.&nbsp; The benefits of these contemplative techniques can also be explained with a detailed understanding of medical science. How amazing that the masters of old could have knowledge that is so true, so exact, and so pertinent to our health in the modern world. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this book, we have attempted to provide the most useful information for those interested in starting to practice wind energy training, using medical science as a starting point. Yantra Yoga, with its rich oral and textual tradition, has its own parallel way of describing the negative effects of oxygen and carbon-dioxide deprivation on the body, mind and emotions. By weaving together the knowledge of these two sources, the modern and the mystical, we hope many readers of this book will be inspired to start working with the tradition of wind energy training."</p><h2>John Bunyan: Writer of Pilgrims Progress</h2><p>Follows the life of the seventeenth-century English preacher, writer, and servant of God, describing his spiritual growth, defense of religious dissent, and years spent in prison writing &#34;Pilgrim&#39;s Progress&#34; and other books.</p><p></p><h2>Heaven: Better by Far- Answers to Questions About the Believer&#39;s Final Hope</h2><p>&#x201c;In our dollar-oriented and materialistic world, the subject of heaven has been relegated to the back burner.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;J. Oswald Sanders<br> &nbsp;<br> Heaven. It&#x2019;s a topic we don&#x2019;t often discuss; and when we do, we&#x2019;re not exactly sure what to think. As author J. Oswald Sanders neared the end of his own life, he was curious too. So he searched Scripture to find out what it said about heaven being the final home for believers. He gathered biblical insights for himself as well as to share with you about the timeless topic of eternity and what that looks like.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written in a question and answer format, <i>Heaven Better by Far</i> is an easy-to-read book that will answer your questions about heaven and eternity. You&#x2019;ll find answers directly from Scripture regarding common questions like:<br> &nbsp;<br> What is death anyway?<br> How do we gain entrance into heaven?<br> Will we know one another in heaven?<br> What will we do in heaven?<br> &nbsp;<br> Challenge the popular notions about heaven and find out from a biblical perspective what awaits believers at the end of our earthly life.</p><p><p><i>Heaven: Better By Far </i>is a rare digest of biblical insights into the timeless topic of heaven, and the finale of one who prepared himself for nearly a century for that day when he would experience how heaven is better by far.</p> <p>If your idea of heaven is having a "mansion just over the hilltop," J. Oswald Sanders has important news for you. While heaven will provide a final home for those who love God, the author of <i>Heaven: Better By Far </i>explains that "so incredibly&nbsp;glorious is heaven that we are compelled to express it in negations and symbols of grandeur and majesty." He says the popular view--that heaven is like the most luxurious place we know, only better--falls far short of reality.</p> <p>Recognizing that he was near heaven's gates, Sanders approached the subject with more than a scholarly interest. His honesty caused him to challenge some popular notions, and his personal curiosity prompted him to address many relevant questions, such as:</p> <p>What is Death Anyway?</p> <p>How Do We Gain Entrance to Heaven?</p> <p>Is Heaven a Place or a State of Mind?</p> <p>Will We Know One Another in Heaven?</p> <p>What Will Our Resurrection Bodies Be Like?</p> <p>What Will We Do in Heaven?</p> <p>What Will Heaven Be Like?</p> <p>Will Mansions Be Awaiting Us?</p> <p>Who Will Receive Rewards?</p><p>Dr. John Oswald Sanders (1902&#x2013;1992) was an international Christian preacher, missionary statesman, and prolific author for nearly seventy years and wrote over forty books on spiritual living.

With servants to wait on him hand and foot and his every wish granted with the right amount of money, life is easy. But, what happens when a mysterious thief steals something very important and irreplaceable from that young boy? </li></ul></p><p>The different settings for the stories in this single-volume yaoi collection provide variety in approach and mood. The first and longest is a costume drama featuring two unnamed aristocrats fighting boredom. One, disguised as a masked thief, kidnaps and ravages the other, who then finds ways to meet the thief again. After their teasing, love/hate encounters, the thief downplays the victim's sexual prowess, which only eggs him on. It's like <i>From Eroica with Love</i>, only with a more modern art style and more explicit encounters. The lush lives of these characters provide room for wide romantic fantasy, and the sketchy, suggestive storytelling allows plenty of space for reader imagination around the poetic rogue, a classic seductive ideal. The second story is a generic tale of schoolboys initiating one another into their sexual ways, but the third presents the unusual angle of love between a congressman who's being pressured to get married and his assistant, who's also his boyfriend. The unusual premise will likely make the forced separation between two characters who clearly care for each other more plausible to the reader, even if U.S. culture makes the happy ending not so realistic. <i>(Sept.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the kitchen window, the view was astounding, and Samantha Evans halted in her duties for a moment to drink it in.<br><br>The Rockies dominated the vast curtain of sky, their peaks laced with snow, though it was late March.<br><br>Samantha wondered if she would still be in Wyoming the following winter. She dreamed of long walks with the air biting and sharp on her cheeks, or wild rides on a spirited mount with hooves kicking up a flurry of white. But none of that could happen until her sister was well enough to be left alone.<br><br>A frown creased her smooth brow. Sabrina was her reason for being in Wyoming, with its majestic mountains and quiet plains, rather than in the more familiar surroundings of Philadelphia's tall buildings and traffic-choked streets.<br><br>The two sisters had always been close, with that special, magical intimacy that twins share. They were not identical. Though they were the same in height and build, Samantha's eyes were a dark cornflower blue, widely set, with thick, spiky lashes, while Sabrina's eyes were a light gray. Both faces were oval set with small, straight noses and well-shaped mouths, but while Samantha's rich brown hair, with its highlights of gold, was shoulder length with a fringe of bangs, Sabrina's ash blond was short, framing her face with delicate curls. The bond between them was strong and enduring. Even when Sabrina had married Dan Lomax and moved so many miles away to settle on his ranch in the Laramie Basin, their devotion had remained constant and unwavering.<br><br>They kept in touch by phone and letter, which helped to mitigate Samantha's aching loneliness. And she was happy in her sister's delight in the coming baby. The two women had laughed and planned together over the phone. But that was before Dan's call. Samantha had been aroused from a deep predawn sleep by the shrill ringing of the phone. She reached groggily for it, but was instantly alerted by the anxious tone of her brother-in-law's voice. "Sam," he said without any preamble, "Bree's been very ill. We did manage to save the baby, but she has to be very careful for a while now. She will have to stay in bed and have constant round-the-clock care. We are trying to find someone to&#x2014;"<br><br>Samantha had only one thought&#x2014;her sister, the person she loved best in the world. "Don't worry, Dan, I will come immediately."<br><br>She was on the plane to Wyoming less than twenty-four hours later...<br><br>The whistle of the kettle brought Samantha back to the present. She began to brew the herbal tea, placing delicate floral cups on a silver tray.<br><br>"Teatime," she called as she entered the living room. Sabrina was propped up with pillows and comforters on the long wood-edged sofa. Though her smile was warm, her cheeks still retained a delicate pallor.<br><br>"Just like the movies," Sabrina commented as her sister set a tray on the pine table. "But the role of Ca-mille is getting to be a bore."<br><br>"I imagine so." Samantha poured the fragrant tea into cups. "But you may as well get used to it, Bree, you've got the part for a month's run." She transferred a large gray-striped cat from Sabrina's lap to her own, offered Sabrina a steaming cup and sat on the rug. "Has Shy-lock been keeping you company?"<br><br>"He's a terrible snob." With a wry smile, Sabrina sipped at her tea. "He did graciously allow me to scratch his ears. I have to admit, I'm glad you brought him with you, he's my biggest entertainment." She sighed and lay back against the pillows, regarding her sister seriously. "I'm ashamed to be lying here feeling sorry for myself. I'm lucky." She rested her hand on her stomach in a protective gesture. "I shall have my baby, and I sit here moaning about your waiting on me."<br><br>"You're entitled to moan a bit, Bree," said Samantha, immediately sympathetic. "You're used to being active and busy."<br><br>"I've no right to complain. You gave up your job and left home to come out here and take care of me." Another deep sigh escaped, and her gray eyes were dangerously moist. "If Dan had told me what you were planning to do, I would never have allowed it."<br><br>"You couldn't have stopped me." Samantha attempted to lighten the mood. "That's what older sisters are for."<br><br>"You never forget those seven minutes, do you?" Sabrina's eyes cleared, and a reluctant smile curved her generous mouth.<br><br>"Nope, it gives me seniority."<br><br>"But your job, Sam."<br><br>"Don't worry." Samantha made another dismissive gesture. "I'll get another job in the fall. There's more than one high school in the country, and they all have gym teachers. Besides, I needed a vacation."<br><br>"Vacation!" Sabrina exclaimed. "Cleaning, cooking, caring for an invalid. You call that a vacation?"<br><br>"My dear Sabrina, have you ever tried to teach an overweight, totally uncoordinated teenager the intricacies of the parallel bars? Well, the stories I could tell you about vacations."<br><br>"Sam, what a pair we are. You with your teenagers and me with my preadolescent Mozarts. Lord knows how many times I cleaned peanut butter off the keys of that old Wurlitzer before Dan came along and took me away from scales and infant prodigies. Do you think Mom expected us to come to this when she dragged us to all those lessons?"<br><br>"Ah, but we're well-rounded." Samantha's grin was faintly wicked. "Aren't you grateful? She always told us we'd be grateful one day for the ballet and the piano lessons."<br><br>"The voice lessons and the riding lessons," Sabrina continued, ticking them off on her fingers.<br><br>"Gymnastics and swimming lessons," Sabrina concluded with a giggle.<br><br>"Poor Mom." Samantha shifted Shylock to a more comfortable position. "I think she expected one of us to marry the president, and she wanted us to be prepared."<br><br>"We shouldn't make fun." Sabrina wiped her eyes with a tissue. "The lessons did give us our living."<br><br>"True. And I can still whip up a mean spinach souffle."<br><br>"Ugh." Sabrina grimaced, and Samantha lifted her brows.<br><br>"Exactly."<br><br>"You have your medals," Sabrina reminded her. Her smile warmed with pride and a trace of awe.<br><br>"Yes, I have the medals and the memories. Sometimes, it feels like yesterday instead of nearly ten years ago."<br><br>Sabrina smiled. "I can still remember my terrified excitement when you first swung onto the uneven bars. Even though I'd watched the routine countless times, I couldn't quite believe it was you. When they put that first Olympic medal around your neck, it was one of the happiest moments of my life."<br><br>"I remember thinking just before that competition, after I'd botched the balance beam so badly, that I couldn't do it. My legs felt like petroleum jelly, and I was mortally afraid I was going to be sick and disgrace myself. Then I saw Mom in the stands, and it ran through my mind how much she'd sacrificed. Not the money. The bending of those rather strange values of hers to allow me those years of training and those few heady moments of competition. I had to prove it was justified, I had to pay her back with something, even though I knew she'd never be able to say she was proud of me."<br><br>"You proved it was justified." Sabrina gave her twin a soft smile. "Even if you hadn't won on the bars and the floor exercises, you'd proved it by just being there. And she was proud of you, even if she didn't say it."<br><br>"You've always understood. So get over the idea I'm doing you a favor coming here. I want to be here. I <em>belong </em>here."<br><br>"Sam." Sabrina held out a hand. "I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't know what I <em>ever </em>would have done without you."<br><br>"You'd manage," Samantha returned, giving the frail hand a squeeze. "You have Dan."<br><br>"Yeah, I do." The smile became soft. "This is the time of day that I miss him most. He should be home soon." Her gaze wandered to the glass-domed anniversary clock on the mantel above the fire.<br><br>"He said something about checking fences today. I can't quite get away from the image of him chasing rustlers or fighting off renegade Indians."<br><br>With a light laugh, Sabrina settled back among the cushions. "City slicker. You know, Sam, sometimes I can't even remember what Philadelphia looks like. Jake Tanner was riding along with Dan today to make sure the boundary fences were in good repair."<br><br>"Jake Tanner?" Samantha's question was idle.<br><br>"Oh, that's right, you haven't met him yet. The northwest corner of the ranch borders his. Of course, the Lazy L would fit into one corner of his ranch. He owns half the county."<br><br>"Ah, a land baron," Samantha concluded.<br><br>"A very apt description," Sabrina agreed. "The Double T, his ranch, is the most impressive I've seen. He runs it like clockwork, super efficient. Dan says he's not only an incredible rancher, but a very crafty businessman."<br><br>"Sounds like a bore," Samantha commented, wrinkling her nose. "Steel-gray hair around a leathered face, a handlebar mustache drooping over his mouth and a generous belly hanging over his belt.."<br><br>Sabrina's laughter rang out, high and sweet.<br><br>"You're about as far off the mark as you can get. Jake Tanner is anything but a bore, and speaking from the safety of marital bliss, he's a fascinating man to look at. And, being rich, successful and unattached, all the females under forty buzz around him like bees around honey."<br><br>"Sounds like a good catch," Samantha said dryly. "Mom would love him."<br><br>"Absolutely," Sabrina agreed. "But Jake has eluded capture so far. Though from what Dan says, he does enjoy the chase."<br><br>"Now he sounds like a conceited bore." Samantha tickled Shylock's smooth belly.<br><br>"You can hardly blame him for taking what's offered." Sabrina defended the absent Jake Tanner with a vague movement of her shoulders. "I imagine he'll settle down soon. Lesley Marshall&#x2014;her father's ranch borders the other side of the Double T&#x2014;has her sights set on him. She's a very determined woman, as well as being more than a little spoiled, and dreadfully rich."<br><br>"Sounds like a perfect match."<br><br>"Mmm, maybe," Sabrina murmured. Her face creased in a small frown. "Lesley's nice enough when it suits her, and it's about time Jake had a wife and family. I'm fond of Jake. I'd like to see him set up with someone with more warmth."<br><br>"Listen to the old married woman." Samantha addressed a dozing and unconcerned Shylock. "A year of nuptial bliss, and she can't stand to see anyone unattached."<br><br>"True. I'm going to start on you next."<br><br>"Thanks for the warning."<br><br>"Wyoming's full of good-looking cowboys and handsome ranchers." Sabrina continued to smile as her sister grimaced. "You could find a worse place to settle down."<br><br>"I have no objection to settling here, Bree. I've become quite attached to the wide open spaces. But&#x2014;" she paused significantly "&#x2014;cowboys and ranchers are not among my immediate plans for the future." She rose from the floor in a fluid motion. "I've got to check on that roast. Here." She handed her sister the novel that rested on the table. "Read your love stories, you incurable romantic."<br><br>"You won't be so cynical when you fall in love," Sabrina predicted with the wisdom of experience.<br><br>"Sure." Samantha's grin was indulgent.<br><br>"There'll be bells ringing and fireworks shooting and trumpets blaring." She patted her sister's hand and strolled from the room, calling over her shoulder. "Angels singing, flames leaping..."<br><br>"Just you wait," Sabrina shouted after her.<br><br></p><h2>Arms Wide Open: A Midwife&#39;s Journey</h2><p><p>In this prequel to the highly praised <i>The Blue Cotton Gown, </i>Patricia Harman reaches back to her youthful experiments in living a fully sustainable and natural life in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s in rural Minnesota and on a commune in Ohio, forming alliances with the eco-minded and antiwar counterculture. From those riveting days as a self-taught midwife, delivering babies in cabins and on farms, sometimes in harrowing circumstances, Patsy takes us into the present day, where she faces the challenges of running a women&#x2019;s health clinic with her husband, mothering adult sons, and holding true to her principles and passions in the twenty-first century.<br></p></p><p><p><b>Author of <i>The Midwife of Hope River</i>,&nbsp;Patricia Harman's&nbsp;</b>first book, <i>The Blue Cotton Gown,</i> was called &#x201c;luminescent, ruthlessly authentic, humane, and brilliantly written&#x201d; by author Samuel Shem. Harman lives and works near Morgantown, West Virginia, and has three sons<b>.</b></p><b>Prelude </b><br><br>All the way down Route 119, past Gandeeville, Snake Hollow, and Wolf Run, I&#x2019;m thinking about the baby that died.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t there, didn&#x2019;t even know the family. It happened a few days ago, with another midwife, at a homebirth in Hardy County, on summer solstice, the longest day of the year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Word on the informal West Virginia midwives&#x2019; hotline is that the baby&#x2019;s shoulders got stuck, a grave emergency. The midwife, Jade, tried everything, all the maneuvers she&#x2019;d studied in textbooks and the special tricks she&#x2019;d learned from other practitioners, but nothing worked. They rushed, by ambulance, to the nearest hospital thirty miles away, with the baby&#x2019;s blue head sticking out of the mother, but it was too late. Of course it was too late.<br> &nbsp;<br> Homebirth midwives in West Virginia are legal, but just barely, and there&#x2019;s no doubt the state coroner&#x2019;s office will investigate. Jade is afraid.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are all afraid.<br> &nbsp;<br> We whip around another corner and I lose my supper out the side window. <i>Who do I think I am taking on this kind of responsibility? Why am I risking my life to get to a homebirth of people I hardly know? What am I doing in this Ford station wagon being whipped back and forth as we careen through the night?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> I awake sick with grief, my heart pounding. I&#x2019;m lying on a pillow-padded king-size bed with floral sheets. A man I hardly recognize sleeps next to me. This is Tom, I remind myself: my husband of thirty-three years, a person whose body and mind are as familiar to me as my own. I prop myself up on an elbow, inspecting his broad shoulders, smooth face, straight nose and full lips, his short silver hair, in the silver moonlight. One hairy leg sticks out of the covers. One arm, with the wide hand and sensitive surgeon&#x2019;s fingers, circles his pillow. It&#x2019;s 3:45, summer solstice morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I rise and pull on my long white terry robe, I stand for a moment, getting my bearings, then open the bedroom door that squeaks and pad across the carpeted living room. Outside the tall corner windows, the trees dance in the dark. Once I called myself Trillium Stone. That was my pen name when I lived in rural communes, wrote for our political rag, <i>The Wild Currents</i>, taught the first natural-childbirth classes, and started doing homebirths.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now I&#x2019;m a nurse-midwife with short graying hair, who no longer delivers babies, living with an ob-gyn in this lakefront home, so far from where I ever thought I would live, so far from where I ever <i>wanted </i>to live. I search the photographs on the piano of my three handsome sons, now men. Do I wake? Do I sleep?<br> &nbsp;<br> OK, my life has been a wild ride, I&#x2019;ll admit it, but the image of this hippie chick lurching through the night, on her way to a homebirth, with only a thick copy of <i>Varney&#x2019;s Midwifery </i>as a guide, disturbs me. What did she think she was doing? Where did she get the balls?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On the highest shelf in the back of our clothes closet, a stack of journals gathers dust. For seventeen years I carried them in a backpack from commune to commune. They&#x2019;ve moved with me across the country three times, through midwifery school, Tom&#x2019;s medical school and his ob-gyn residency. I can&#x2019;t get the diaries out of my mind, a mute witness to my life . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> I slip back through the bedroom. Tom snores on. By the dim closet light, I find a stepladder and struggle to bring down the shabby container. The journals have been closed for twenty-five years; pages stick together and smell faintly of mold.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m on a mission now, trying to understand, but I&#x2019;m surprised to find that I started each entry with only the day and the month, no year. This is going to take a while. It seems I never expected anyone would want to reconstruct my life, not even me. I&#x2019;m an archaeologist digging through my own past.<br> &nbsp;<br> With narrowed eyes, I flip through notebook after notebook, daring that flower child to show her face. When the alarm goes off, Tom, dressed in blue scrubs for the OR, finds me asleep in the white canvas chair, with a red journal open, over my heart.</p><h2>Visions of Excellence; The Art of Achieving Your Dreams</h2><p>Book by Tewksbury, Mark</p><p></p><h2>Like a Hole in the Head</h2><p>Jill, a part-time bookseller with a biting wit, gets her hands on a rare, first-edition novel by Jack London -- courtesy of a suspicious-looking dwarf. Soon, a polite assassin arrives, with the dwarf in tow, demanding the book back. But Jill has already unloaded the valuable tome, and, as she values her life, immediately sets off to recover it. As an outrageous cast of thugs, sycophants, and central casting rejects join in the chase for the elusive volume and the special secret it contains, Jill finds herself cheated, kidnapped, drugged, tortured, and even forced to work as a movie extra. Twisted and subversive, Jen Banbury&#39;s debut is a mad, breathtaking romp through a hilariously dark vision of contemporary America.</p><p>The same marinade of lonely-girl tough-talk that flavored Barbara Seranella's Edgar Award-nominated first novel, <i>No Human Involved</i>, enriches playwright Jen Banbury's wonderfully raucous and raunchy debut, <i>Like a Hole in the Head</i>. Banbury's mystery is also set in a Los Angeles made memorable by fresh insights. "I took Venice Boulevard," says Jill, who works in a used bookstore. "Past all the two-story apartment buildings where old women laid out their cast-off clothes like a distress signal. They would sit around in beach chairs waiting to sell wrinkled muumuus for two bucks a pop. Past the strip malls with the five dollar manicure places. Past Donut Heaven, Donut Time, Winchell's Donuts, Time for Donuts, I Love Donuts, Falafel and Donuts, Jimmy's Donuts, and Dough-nutty. Past the Hare Krishna temple. I had gone there once for a free vegetarian meal. They asked me to leave before serving me. You have to chant before you can eat and I kept saying 'Hairy Hitler' instead of Hare Krishna. The girl praying next to me blew the whistle. I was hungry and I shouldn't have been such a wiseass. I've heard the food is pretty good." There's also a plot, of sorts: a rare first edition of a Jack London work drops Jill into a bizarre and dangerous substrata of desperate dwarfs, failed actors, and lethal antiquarian book dealers....."Like a Hole in the Head" is a lively send-up of the traditional mystery novel: it can be read as a slapstick answer to "The Maltese Falcon." Jill is just as hard-boiled as Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade, and she's a lot funnier.... <p>This isn't a novel that asks to be taken seriously; there's an intentionally cartoonish quality to almost all its characters and situations. The major exception is Jill, who's a thoroughly appealing heroine - quick-witted, resourceful and surprisingly tenderhearted.... </p><p>Banbury does stumble now and then. Her sense of humor, which at its best is a pleasure, too often descends to the level of the sophomoric.... If you're looking for subtle wit and exquisite literary artistry-if you've just finished reading the collected works of Jane Austen, say, and you're looking for a contemporary equivalent - "Like a Hold in the Head" would not be the best place to start. </p><p>If, on the other hand, you're looking for a fast-paced comic novel with a wisecracking heroine who's rowdy, crude, good natured and smart, you need look no further. "Like a Hole in the Head" is an enjoyable debut from a gifted new writer. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, May 3, 1998</i><br><br>...an exhilarating, disturbing vision of a hostile cultural landscape. -- <i>The San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Handel</i><br><br>A marinade of loney-girl tough-talk enriches playwright Jen Banbury's wonderfully raucous and raunchy debut mystery, set in Los Angeles made memorable by fresh insights.

Her heroine is the smart-alecky yet winsome Jill, a slacker whose chief responsibilities are keeping the pantry stocked with Cap'n Crunch and ringing up paperbacks at a used bookstore. When a suspicious-looking dwarf comes in to unload a handsome first edition of Jack London's "The Cruise of the Snark," all hell breaks loose, and Jill is forced to take control of herself and the impossible situation that has sprung up around her. But even as Jill finds herself in a life-threatening cross-fire among unsavory parties vying for the ultra-rare, six-figure volume, she refuses to become a boring adult. During one abduction, she's asked what kind of films she likes. "Kidnapping flicks" is the answer. Jill's taste in sarcasm and malt liquor keep her, and the book, going; Jack London would have admired her survival instincts, and he'd recognize Banbury's L.A. as an untamable wilderness. -- <i>Los Angeles Times, September 6, 1998</i></p></p><h2>Antique Quilts Recreated (Leisure Arts #3496)</h2><p>Give your home that special feel of days gone by with this new volume of classic, traditional quilts.

Her parents were Southern Presbyterian missionaries, most often stationed in China, and from childhood, Pearl spoke both English and Chinese. She returned to China shortly after graduation from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1914, and the following year, she met a young agricultural economist named John Lossing Buck. They married in 1917, and immediately moved to Nanhsuchou in rural Anhwei province. In this impoverished community, Pearl Buck gathered the material that she would later use in <i>The Good Earth</i> and other stories of China.<p>Pearl began to publish stories and essays in the 1920s, in magazines such as <i>The Nation, The Chinese Recorder, Asia,</i> and <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i> Her first novel, <i>East Wind, West Wind,</i> was published by the John Day Company in 1930. John Day's publisher, Richard Walsh, would eventually become Pearl's second husband, in 1935, after both received divorces.</p><p>In 1931, John Day published Pearl's second novel, <i>The Good Earth.</i> This became the bestselling book of both 1931 and 1932, won the Pulitzer Prize and the Howells Medal in 1935, and would be adapted as a major MGM film in 1937. Other novels and books of nonfiction quickly followed. In 1938, less than a decade after her first book had appeared, Pearl won the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. By the time of her death in 1973, Pearl had published more than seventy books: novels, collections of stories, biography and autobiography, poetry, drama, children's literature, and translations from the Chinese. She is buried at Green Hills Farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> It was Wang Lung's marriage day. At first, opening his eyes in the blackness of the curtains about his bed, he could not think why the dawn seemed different from any other. The house was still except for the faint, gasping cough of his old father, whose room was opposite to his own across the middle room. Every morning the old man's cough was the first sound to be heard. Wang Lung usually lay listening to it and moved only when he heard it approaching nearer and when he heard the door of his father's room squeak upon its wooden hinges. </p><p> But this morning he did not wait. He sprang up and pushed aside the curtains of his bed. It was a dark, ruddy dawn, and through a small square hole of a window, where the tattered paper fluttered, a glimpse of bronze sky gleamed. He went to the hole and tore the paper away. </p><p> "It is spring and I do not need this," he muttered. </p><p> He was ashamed to say aloud that he wished the house to look neat on this day. The hole was barely large enough to admit his hand and he thrust it out to feel of the air. A small soft wind blew gently from the east, a wind mild and murmurous and full of rain. It was a good omen. The fields needed rain for fruition. There would be no rain this day, but within a few days, if this wind continued, there would be water. It was good. Yesterday he had said to his father that if this brazen, glittering sunshine continued, the wheat could not fill in the ear. Now it was as if Heaven had chosen this day to wish him well. Earth would bear fruit. </p><p> He hurried out into the middle room, drawing on his blue outer trousers as he went, and knotting about the fullness at his waist his girdle of blue cotton cloth. He left his upper body bare until he had heated water to bathe himself. He went into the shed which was the kitchen, leaning against the house, and out of its dusk an ox twisted its head from behind the corner next the door and lowed at him deeply. The kitchen was made of earthen bricks as the house was, great squares of earth dug from their own fields, and thatched with straw from their own wheat. Out of their own earth had his grandfather in his youth fashioned also the oven, baked and black with many years of meal preparing. On top of this earthen structure stood a deep, round, iron cauldron. </p><p> This cauldron he filled partly full of water, dipping it with a half gourd from an earthen jar that stood near, but he dipped cautiously, for water was precious. Then, after a hesitation, he suddenly lifted the jar and emptied all the water into the cauldron. This day he would bathe his whole body. Not since he was a child upon his mother's knee had anyone looked upon his body. Today one would, and he would have it clean. </p><p> He went around the oven to the rear, and selecting a handful of the dry grass and stalks standing in the corner of the kitchen, he arranged it delicately in the mouth of the oven, making the most of every leaf. Then from an old flint and iron he caught a flame and thrust it into the straw and there was a blaze. </p><p> This was the last morning he would have to light the fire. He had lit it every morning since his mother died six years before. He had lit the fire, boiled water, and poured the water into a bowl and taken it into the room where his father sat upon his bed, coughing and fumbling for his shoes upon the floor. Every morning for these six years the old man had waited for his son to bring in hot water to ease him of his morning coughing. Now father and son could rest. There was a woman coming to the house. Never again would Wang Lung have to rise summer and winter at dawn to light the fire. He could lie in his bed and wait, and he also would have a bowl of water brought to him, and if the earth were fruitful there would be tea leaves in the water. Once in some years it was so. </p><p> And if the woman wearied, there would be her children to light the fire, the many children she would bear to Wang Lung. Wang Lung stopped, struck by the thought of children running in and out of their three rooms. Three rooms had always seemed much to them, a house half empty since his mother died. They were always having to resist relatives who were more crowded -- his uncle, with his endless brood of children, coaxing. </p><p> "Now, how can two lone men need so much room? Cannot father and son sleep together? The warmth of the young one's body will comfort the old one's cough." </p><p> But the father always replied, "I am saving my bed for my grandson. He will warm my bones in my age." </p><p> Now the grandsons were coming, grandsons upon grandsons! They would have to put beds along the walls and in the middle room. The house would be full of beds. The blaze in the oven died down while Wang Lung thought of all the beds there would be in the half empty house, and the water began to chill in the cauldron. The shadowy figure of the old man appeared in the doorway, holding his unbuttoned garments about him. He was coughing and spitting and he gasped. </p><p> "How is it that there is not water yet to heat my lungs?" </p><p> Wang Lung stared and recalled himself and was ashamed. </p><p> "This fuel is damp," he muttered from behind the stove. </p><p> "The damp wind -- " </p><p> The old man continued to cough perseveringly and would not cease until the water boiled. Wang Lung dipped some into a bowl, and then, after a moment, he opened a glazed jar that stood upon a ledge of the stove and took from it a dozen or so of the curled dried leaves and sprinkled them upon the surface of the water. The old man's eyes opened greedily and immediately he began to complain. </p><p> "Why are you wasteful? Tea is like eating silver." </p><p> "It is the day," replied Wang Lung with a short laugh. "Eat and be comforted." </p><p> The old man grasped the bowl in his shriveled, knotty fingers, muttering, uttering little grunts. He watched the leaves uncurl and spread upon the surface of the water, unable to bear drinking the precious stuff. </p><p> "It will be cold," said Wang Lung. </p><p> "True -- true -- " said the old man in alarm, and he began to take great gulps of the hot tea. He passed into an animal satisfaction, like a child fixed upon its feeding. But he was not too forgetful to see Wang Lung dipping the water recklessly from the cauldron into a deep wooden tub. He lifted his head and stared at his son. </p><p> "Now there is water enough to bring a crop to fruit," he said suddenly. </p><p> Wang Lung continued to dip the water to the last drop. He did not answer. </p><p> "Now then!" cried his father loudly. </p><p> "I have not washed my body all at once since the New Year," said Wang Lung in a low voice. </p><p> He was ashamed to say to his father that he wished his body to be clean for a woman to see. He hurried out, carrying the tub to his own room. The door was hung loosely upon a warped wooden frame and it did not shut closely, and the old man tottered into the middle room and put his mouth to the opening and bawled, </p><p> "It will be ill if we start the woman like this -- tea in the morning water and all this washing!" </p><p> "It is only one day," shouted Wang Lung. And then he added, "I will throw the water on the earth when I am finished and it is not all waste." </p><p> The old man was silent at this, and Wang Lung unfastened his girdle and stepped out of his clothing. In the light that streamed in a square block from the hole he wrung a small towel from the steaming water and he scrubbed his dark slender body vigorously. Warm though he had thought the air, when his flesh was wet he was cold, and he moved quickly, passing the towel in and out of the water until from his whole body there went up a delicate cloud of steam. Then he went to a box that had been his mother's and drew from it a fresh suit of blue cotton cloth. He might be a little cold this day without the wadding of the winter garments, but he suddenly could not bear to put them on against his clean flesh. The covering of them was torn and filthy and the wadding stuck out of the holes, grey and sodden. He did not want this woman to see him for the first time with the wadding sticking out of his clothes. Later she would have to wash and mend, but not the first day. He drew over the blue cotton coat and trousers a long robe made of the same material -- his one long robe, which he wore on feast days only, ten days or so in the year, all told. Then with swift fingers he unplaited the long braid of hair that hung down his back, and taking a wooden comb from the drawer of the small, unsteady table, he began to comb out his hair. </p><p> His father drew near again and put his mouth to the crack of the door. </p><p> "Am I to have nothing to eat this day?" he complained. "At my age the bones are water in the morning until food is given them." </p><p> "I am coming," said Wang Lung, braiding his hair quickly and smoothly and weaving into the strands a tasseled, black silk cord. </p><p> Then after a moment he removed his long gown and wound his braid about his head and went out, carrying the tub of water. He had quite forgotten the breakfast. He would stir a little water into corn meal and give it to his father. For himself he could not eat. He staggered with the tub to the threshold and poured the water upon the earth nearest the door, and as he did so he remembered he had used all the water in the cauldron for his bathing and he would have to start the fire again. A wave of anger passed over him at his father. </p><p> "That old head thinks of nothing except his eating and his drinking," he muttered into the mouth of the oven; but aloud he said nothing. It was the last morning he would have to prepare food for the old man. He put a very little water into the cauldron, drawing it in a bucket from the well near the door, and it boiled quickly and he stirred meal together and took it to the old man. </p><p> "We will have rice this night, my father," he said. "Meanwhile, here is corn." </p><p> "There is only a little rice left in the basket," said the old man, seating himself at the table in the middle room and stirring with his chopsticks the thick yellow gruel. </p><p> "We will eat a little less then at the spring festival," said Wang Lung. But the old man did not hear. He was supping loudly at his bowl. </p><p> Wang Lung went into his own room then, and drew about him again the long blue robe and let down the braid of his hair. He passed his hand over his shaven brow and over his cheeks. Perhaps he had better be newly shaven? It was scarcely sunrise yet. He could pass through the Street of the Barbers and be shaved before he went to the house where the woman waited for him. If he had the money he would do it. </p><p> He took from his girdle a small greasy pouch of grey cloth and counted the money in it. There were six silver dollars and a double handful of copper coins. He had not yet told his father he had asked friends to sup that night. He had asked his male cousin, the young son of his uncle, and his uncle for his father's sake, and three neighboring farmers who lived in the village with him. He had planned to bring back from the town that morning pork, a small pond fish, and a handful of chestnuts. He might even buy a few of the bamboo sprouts from the south and a little beef to stew with the cabbage he had raised in his own garden. But this only if there were any money left after the bean oil and the soybean sauce had been bought. If he shaved his head he could not, perhaps, buy the beef. Well, he would shave his head, he decided suddenly. </p><p> He left the old man without speech and went out into the early morning. In spite of the dark red dawn the sun was mounting the horizon clouds and sparkled upon the dew on the rising wheat and barley. The farmer in Wang Lung was diverted for an instant and he stooped to examine the budding heads. They were empty as yet and waiting for the rain. He smelled the air and looked anxiously at the sky. Rain was there, dark in the clouds, heavy upon the wind. He would buy a stick of incense and place it in the little temple to the Earth God. On a day like this he would do it. </p><p> He wound his way in among the fields upon the narrow path. In the near distance the grey city wall arose. Within that gate in the wall through which he would pass stood the great house where the woman had been a slave girl since her childhood, the House of Hwang. There were those who said, "It is better to live alone than to marry a woman who has been slave in a great house." But when he had said to his father, "Am I never to have a woman?" his father replied, "With weddings costing as they do in these evil days and every woman wanting gold rings and silk clothes before she will take a man, there remain only slaves to be had for the poor." </p><p> His father had stirred himself, then, and gone to the House of Hwang and asked if there were a slave to spare. </p><p> "Not a slave too young, and above all, not a pretty one," he had said. </p><p> Wang Lung had suffered that she must not be pretty. It would be something to have a pretty wife that other men would congratulate him upon having. His father, seeing his mutinous face, had cried out at him, </p><p> "And what will we do with a pretty woman? We must have a woman who will tend the house and bear children as she works in the fields, and will a pretty woman do these things? She will be forever thinking about clothes to go with her face! No, not a pretty woman in our house. We are farmers. Moreover, who has heard of a pretty slave who was virgin in a wealthy house? All the young lords have had their fill of her. It is better to be first with an ugly woman than the hundredth with a beauty. Do you imagine a pretty woman will think your farmer's hands as pleasing as the soft hands of a rich man's son, and your sunblack face as beautiful as the golden skin of the others who have had her for their pleasure?" </p><p> Wang Lung knew his father spoke well. Nevertheless, he had to struggle with his flesh before he could answer. And then he said violently, </p><p> "At least, I will not have a woman who is pock-marked, or who has a split upper lip." </p><p> "We will have to see what is to be had," his father replied. </p><p> Well, the woman was not pock-marked nor had she a split upper lip. This much he knew, but nothing more. He and his father had bought two silver rings, washed with gold, and silver earrings, and these his father had taken to the woman's owner in acknowledgment of betrothal. Beyond this, he knew nothing of the woman who was to be his, except that on this day he could go and get her. </p><p> He walked into the cool darkness of the city gate. Water carriers, just outside, their barrows laden with great tubs of water, passed to and fro all day, the water splashing out of the tubs upon the stones. It was always wet and cool in the tunnel of the gate under the thick wall of earth and brick; cool even upon a summer's day, so that the melon vendors spread their fruits upon the stones, melons split open to drink in the moist coolness. There were none yet, for the season was too early, but baskets of small hard green peaches stood along the walls, and the vendor cried out, </p><p> "The first peaches of spring -- the first peaches! Buy, eat, purge your bowels of the poisons of winter!" </p><p> Wang Lung said to himself, </p><p> "If she likes them, I will buy her a handful when we return." ...</p></p><h2>The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume Twelve (12)</h2><p>The latest in a series that has been called &#x201c;a must-read for fans of science fiction, fantasy, and short stories in general&#x201d;<br><br>Science fiction is a portal that opens doors onto futures too rich and strange to imagine.

After a brief overview of tools and materials, the entertaining hands-on activities begin with contour drawing techniques. With the help of lots of exercises, budding artists will learn the basic elements of shapes (lines, dots, circles) and see how to combine them to make familiar forms. They'll find out how to produce the illusion of volume with shading techniques; create perspective; accurately recreate landscapes, people, animals, and nature; develop interesting compositions; and more.<br></p><p>Kathryn Temple is a celebrated visual artist and writer who has taught art to children in school and camp settings. Her paintings have been exhibited in dozens of group and solo shows, have earned her artist grants and residences, and can be found in private and corporate collections throughout the country. She is also the author and illustrator of <i>Art for Kids: Drawing in Color</i> (also Sterling), and lives in Asheville, NC.Grade 4-7&#x2013;This first-class introduction to essential drawing techniques builds from the starting points of lines and simple shapes. Typically, books for this audience present step-by-step directions for rendering specific objects, animals, or people; with Temple's work, children can use the skills taught here to go beyond the examples and draw their own unique illustrations. The author limits the scope of the book to drawing with pencils. Eight concise chapters explore seeing with artist's eyes, line drawing, light and shadow, proportion and scale, perspective, drawing faces, drawing bodies, and using imagination. The succinct text reads smoothly and is written in a clear, understandable style. Sample sketches and crisp, color photographs extend the text and often serve as the basis for many purposeful exercises. These illustrations are precisely placed with the appropriate corresponding text and are enhanced by supplementary details that have been highlighted with sweeps of color. Librarians looking for materials that focus more on the process of drawing than on the product will find this refreshing selection to be a useful resource for budding artists.<i>&#x2013;Lynn K.

His account of speaker-meaning is the standard that others use to define their own minor divergences or future elaborations. His discussion of conversational implicatures has given philosophers an important tool for the investigation of all sorts of problems; it has also laid the foundation for a great deal of work by other philosophers and linguists about presupposition. His metaphysical defense of absolute values is starting to be considered the beginning of a new phase in philosophy. This is a vital book for all who are interested in Anglo-American philosophy. </p></p><p>Paul Grice provided philosophy with crucial ideas. His account of speakermeaning is the standard that others use to define their own minor divergences or future elaborations.Grice was a miniaturist who changed the way other people paint big canvases.

For 50 years Larry Harmon was the face&#x2014;and the nose&#x2014;of Bozo the Clown, the most well-known, beloved clown of them all, the precursor for every successful modern-day harlequin to come, from Ronald McDonald to Krusty. A warm, surprising, and endlessly entertaining life story filled to the brim with &#x201c;Assassins, Astronauts, Cannibals, and Other Stupendous Tales,&#x201d; <em>The Man Behind the Nose </em>is a rollicking ride through the world of a true American icon in greasepaint.</p></p><p><p>Did you hear the one about when Bozo the Clown ran for President and two assassination attempts were made on his life?</p><p>How about the time Bozo flew into the perilous jungles of New Guinea to see if he could not just survive but actually bond with dangerous cannibal tribes? </p><p>Well then, you must know about the time his size 83 AAA shoes saved him from being swallowed whole by a giant, murderous python in Thailand, right?</p><p>Then I guess you might not know as much as you think about the world's most famous clown. Sure, you know the giant shoes, the red bulbous nose, the big ruby smile, and the twin shocks of red yak-hair bursting from the sides of his head. And obviously you know the many clowns inspired by him, from Ronald McDonald to Krusty the Clown.</p><p>So perhaps it's time you learned about Bozo, and the man behind the nose. Because the wild, inspirational stories in this book are all true. As real as the nose on your face.</p><p>One day, Larry Harmon, a World War II private harboring dreams of becoming a doctor, met the most famous entertainer of the time, Al Jolson. After seeing the young man on stage, Jolson told him he shouldconsider a career change.</p><p>"Being a doctor of medicine is honorable," Jolson advised. "But you'll touch so many more lives as a doctor of laughter!"</p><p>A decade later, Jolson's prophecy came true when Larry Harmon, trying to make it as an actor in Hollywood, auditioned to portray a character named Bozo the Capitol Clown.</p><p>The character spoke so much to Larry that he simply <em>became</em> it&#x2014;overnight. He soon turned Bozo into a cultural icon, creating one of the biggest children's television franchises in the world. But that was only the beginning. </p><p>In this unputdownable book, which Harmon completed just before his death at age eighty-three, are far more incredible stories of astronauts, cannibals, celebrities, assassins, and deep-sea divers&#x2014;all encountered in full Bozo regalia, and with photos to prove it. </p><p>Not only is Harmon's life by turns incredible and hilarious, it's also an inspirational testament to the power of one man's positive attitude, dedication, and work ethic&#x2014;and how he changed the world.</p><p>Larry Harmon produced some 50,000 hours of local and international live children's television shows. He is best-known for his fifty-year-plus run as the driving force behind Bozo the World's Most Famous Clown. After purchasing the rights to the character, Harmon spread Bozo to almost 200 television stations all over the globe, including Greece, Thailand, and Brazil. Harmon also owned the Laurel &amp; Hardy characters, produced the 1974 biopic <em>It's Good to be Alive</em> directed by Michael Landon, and made many other contributions to the entertainment world and popular culture. In 1996, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences awarded him a special outstanding achievement award for a long career that touched the hearts, mind, and funny bones of millions of people.

Suppressed in turn by the tzarist and Soviet regime, the tales contained in this book have, for the most part, never been published in English until now. Emerging at last, they offer western readers fresh glimpses of novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy. Divine and Human consists of choice selections from The Sunday Reading Stories, the second volume in a two-part work titled The Circle of Reading. In the words of translator Peter Sekirin, &#34;Tolstoy considered The Circle of Reading to be the major work of his life. Considering its difficult history, it is not surprising that only recently has it been rediscovered.&#34; From its sparkling vignettes to its lengthier stories, Divine and Human probes the complexities of life and faith. Its characters range the spectrum of human emotions and qualities, from hatred to love and joy to grief; from sublime nobility to grotesque self-absorption. Tolstoy&#39;s world, though far-removed from today&#39;s information age, becomes our world -- indeed, has always been and always will be our world. Motor cars may have replaced horse-drawn cars, but human hearts remain the same, and questions of truth, mercy, forgiveness, devotion, justice, and the nature of God knock as insistently on the doors of our lives today as they did in Tolstoy&#39;s time. Welcome, then, to Divine and Human: a buried treasure at last unearthed, and certain to be prized by Tolstoy readers and lovers of great literature.</p><p>Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), Russian nobleman, philosopher, and novelist, authored such classic works as Anna Karenina and War and Peace.<br><br>Peter Sekirin was born in Russia. He received his Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Kiev, Ukraine, where he served as associate professor for several years. In December 1999 Peter obtained his Ph.D. in Russian literature at the University of Toronto. He is the author of The Dostoevsky Archive, the English translator for Tolstoy's Calendar of Wisdom, and has written numerous articles for Linguistics and History of Literature.

That is, when we were splitting up for the first time. It was two summers ago when they first worked their magic, and last summer when they shook up our lives once again. You see, we don&#x2019;t wear the Pants year-round. We let them rest so they are extra powerful when summer comes. (There was the time this spring when Carmen wore them to her mom&#x2019;s wedding, but that was a special case.)<br><br>Now we&#x2019;re facing our last summer together. In September we go to college. And it&#x2019;s not like one of those TV shows where all of us magically turn up at the same college. We&#x2019;re going to four different colleges in four different cities (but all within four hours of one another&#x2014;that was our one rule). We&#x2019;re headed off to start our real lives. <br><br>Tomorrow night at Gilda&#x2019;s we&#x2019;ll launch the Pants on their third summer voyage. Tomorrow begins the time of our lives. It&#x2019;s when we&#x2019;ll need our Pants the most.</p><p>Ages 12 and up. Best buds Tibby, Carmen, Lena and Bridget are back with their magical pair of shared jeans in <i>Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood.</i> Each summer brings new and difficult challenges, as the perennially separated friends discover afresh this last season before college. Tibby struggles with the idea of close friend Brian becoming her boyfriend, and their fragile relationship is soon tested by a tragedy in her immediate family. Carmen doesn&#x2019;t know how to react when she finds out that her middle-aged mom is pregnant, and Bridget is unpleasantly surprised to be reunited with the boy who broke her heart two summers ago. Finally, Lena, still coming to terms with the loss of her first love, tries to convince her strict father that art school is a better career path than Greek restaurant management.

Chatfield of the 113th Illinois Volunteers</h2><p>Fully annotated and meticulously researched, The Chatfield Story: The Civil War Letters and Diaries of Private Edward L. Chatfield of the 113th Illinois Volunteers by Terry M. McCarty with Margaret Ann Chatfield McCarty is a stunning personal biography that illustrates a harrowing part of American history. Resonant, wise, and suspenseful, this elegantly wrought memoir is a story of courage, pluck, and survival against seemingly insurmountable odds. Chatfield&#39;s life as a Union private unfolds with each successive missive, an incredible account from within the Western Theater of the Civil War: Cairo, Memphis, Oxford, Holly Springs, Chickasaw Bayou, Arkansas Post, DeSoto Point, Grand Gulf, Clinton, Vicksburg, Corinth, and Brice&#39;s Cross Roads-where disaster awaited him. Fascinating in its approach and its depth, this spellbinding story of a young man whose name and family became famous in Colorado is a marvelous tale of accomplishment-a decidedly American story that truly begs to be heard.</p><p>Coauthors Terry M. McCarty and Margaret Ann Chatfield McCarty both hold master&#39;s degrees with emphases in the social sciences and human behavior, Terry&#39;s from California State University at Fullerton and Margaret&#39;s from Pepperdine University. A shared love of history prompted their transcription and narration of the letters of Edward L. Chatfield, a great-granduncle to Margaret. When not researching and writing, they enjoy exercise, gardening, storytelling, and visiting their children and grandchildren. They live in Georgetown, Texas, and this is their first book.The McCartys lay bare an improbable story of war, fortitude and survival during a littleknown chapter of the American Civil War. The Chatfield Story is a remarkable personal biography that sheds light on the inner workings of one lone Union private, but also illuminates the psyche of an entire generation. Authors McCarty meticulously annotate each letter and diary entry while providing background narrative before and after, so the reader has the fullest possible understanding of the history, events and the subject in question. Fortified with wartime maps, topographical charts and generous appendices, readers are fully armed and ready to take on this formidable lesson in human endurance, grit and determination. The book is the rare intimate biography that is historically compelling and dramatically satisfying. The story begins with Edward&#39;s birth in Middlefield Township, Ohio, in 1842 and ends 24 years later at the close of the Civil War, following Chatfield through the Western Theater --Cairo, Memphis, Oxford, Holly Springs, Chickasaw Bayou, Arkansas Post, DeSoto Point, Vicksburg, Corinth and other key battlegrounds. Well known in Colorado, the Chatfield story has now come into the zeitgeist through the impeccable efforts of the authors, who have painstakingly researched and documented not only one man&#39;s life, but also the coming-of-age of a nation during its darkest hour. Chatfield&#39;s letters and diary punctuate a lively and dynamic telling of history that is as much an American story as it is a personal memoir. But the real value of this work is that it teaches U.S. history in an accessible, engrossing way. It delivers an entertaining, educational and wholly enjoyable excursion through our shared past and one remarkable life. Easy to read, faultlessly researched and masterfully written. -- Kirkus Discoveries Review</p><h2>The Greatest of Friends: Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill 1941-1945</h2><p>An intimate portrait of the friendship between two of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest leaders reveals their mutual admiration, their successful partnership during World War II, and other historical information.</p><p>Keith Alldritt is a professor of English at the University of British Columbia.In a lively and digestible manner, Alldritt documents both the public and the private bond that existed between two of the most celebrated and powerful political leaders of the twentieth century. Though their official association was foreordained by historical events and circumstances, the intimate friendship that subsequently developed between Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill was multifaceted in nature. Both Roosevelt and Churchill were natural aristocrats, schooled in the classics and infused with a profound sense of noblesse oblige. When the advent of World War II necessitated a confidential partnership between these two charismatic Allied commanders, they discovered and nurtured common ground despite very obvious differences in temperament, psychological makeup, and personal style. According to the author, the complementary and interdependent relationship that evolved between Roosevelt and Churchill during these critical years had a deep and abiding effect upon the course of the war and upon postwar society. An exceptionally vivid portrait of a friendship that shaped history to an extraordinary degree. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i></p><h2>Rockin' the Boat: 50 Iconic Revolutionaries &#x2015; From Joan of Arc to Malcom X</h2><p>We love to root for the underdog, and that's part of why we're drawn to the stories of revolutionaries.

The profiles start with Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca and end with civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. Others include George Washington, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Geronimo, Malcolm X, and Cesar Chavez. As Fleischer mentions in his introduction, some figures are clearly heroes while others are obvious villains, but "most fall somewhere in between." The entries are a few pages long, detailing major accomplishments and lasting influence, with photos and text boxes that add context or highlight interesting facts. Arranged chronologically, the book is heavy on male revolutionaries, particularly at the beginning, with only nine women featured. Though brief, the chapters are still dense and somewhat tedious. The pictures are accompanied by lively captions, such as "Boudica, mid-harangue" or "Emma Goldman is not interested in your nonsense." Unfortunately, this same energetic spirit wasn't injected into the text. VERDICT The concept is better than the content, but readers looking to research a specific person or movement will find this compilation suitable for their needs.&#x2014;Amanda MacGregor, formerly at Apollo High School Library, St. Cloud, MN</p><h2>Florida Keys: A History and Guide</h2><p><i>The Florida Keys: A History &amp; Guide</i> is an engaging handbook to the unique coral and limestone islands that curve southwest off the tip of Florida.

Here, author Joy Williams, whose novels and short stories have won wide literary acclaim, shares with us all of the region's idiosyncrasies and delights.<br><br>From the diving and fishing meccas of Key Largo and Marathon to the funkiness and sophistication of Key West to the remote outpost of Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas,<b> The Florida Keys</b> serves the traveler as a witty and informative companion. Sensitive to and knowledgeable about the natural beauties of the Keys, Williams covers the exquisite underwater world of North America's only living reef and the eerie and delicate serenity of the "backcountry" of Florida Bay. <b>The Florida Keys</b> also provides fresh, up-to-date advice on the practicalities of where to stay, eat, and wander. Here is the quirkiest, most candid, and most literate guide to the Keys.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>The Florida Keys do not run due south. They drift southwest, Route 1 running more east-west than north-south. The Gulf side is actually Florida Bay, the upper reaches of which belong to the Everglades. The Bay side is called the "backcountry" or "outback." The Atlantic side is actually the Straits of Florida, where wide Hawk Channel runs out from shore to the reef, which stretches the length of the Keys. Beyond the reef is the Gulf Stream--"out front"-that great oceanic river whose demarcation is clearly seen, the water being a profound and fabulous blue. Beyond the Gulf Stream lies, then, the ocean. <br><br>The Keys run from Biscayne Bay to the Dry Tortugas, a distance of some 180 miles. No road runs to the keys north of Key Largo-Sands, Elliott, and Old Rhodes-and the Tortugas are 70 watery, wild miles from Key West. The distance accessible by car is some 106 miles-from Key Largo to Key West. That road, originally built in the 1930s, replaced Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Extension railroad line, an amazing piece of engineering which had linked the Keys since 1912 and which was destroyed by a hurricane in 1935. The mile markers (MM #-) referred to in this guide-green signs with white numerals, posted on the right-hand shoulder-were first placed along the Keys by the railroad. <br><br>On a map the Keys look fairly improbable-and Route 1, the line that drops down their sprinkled length, improbable too. The possibilities are vast, but the road itself is simple, which explains why some travelers begin at Key Largo, hang on to the steering wheel, and don't stop until Key West, heeding the billboards' urging, GO ALL THE WAY, with all its attendant, randy implications of reckless fulfillment. Other travelers arrive in the Keys, love them, stick close to Islamorada, and wouldn't dream of going all the way, considering Key West weird if not bizarre, as though that singular and raffish place were at the bottom of an ever-darkening well. <br><br>But of course the Keys don't really go from light to dark. The Keys sparkle downward, warm and bright, full of light and air and a bit of intrigue. The Keys are relaxed, a little reckless. The Keys are water and sky, horizon, daybreak, spectacular sunsets, the cup of night. The least interesting thing about them is the road, but the road, as is its nature, allows entrance. The road is the beginning. <br><br>There are some automobile guides, such as the old Sanborn Guides to Mexico, that are wonderfully jittery backseat companions, not pointing out cathedrals and markets (because the route in question is manifestly lacking in cathedrals and markets) but taking great pains to point out everything else. A child selling an iguana is here; half a kilometer down the road you will pass a most peculiarly shaped boulder; a bit beyond that there was once a Pemex station, though unfortunately a Pemex station is no longer there, only a tire dump; two kilometers away the road curves.... And so on. <br><br>The Keys once lent themselves to this sort of innocent treatment, and in a way they still do. There is the road, and there are the dutiful descending markers accompanying your every mile, suggesting that a trip is little more than coloring your own experience between provided lines. At MM #- there is an egret; at MM #- there's a pretty view between two violet jacaranda trees; at MM #-, if you can wait that long, is a bar where the bartender wears live snakes wrapped around her neck and wrists-her "pretties," she calls them.... And so on. <br><br>Time passes, of course. The snake lady is run over one night as she is crossing the road. Someone builds his dream house in front of the pretty view, cutting down the jacaranda trees in the process. But the Keys, though no longer the empty, silent stretches they once were, still markedly lack (you might as well be told) historical and cultural monuments. And the osprey still builds his nest larger each year at MM # . And the tarpon still roll and flash each spring under the bridge at MM # <br><br>And certainly at MM #- the disreputable bar remains. The best way to enjoy the Keys is still to seek out their simplicity and their eccentricity. <br><br>The Keys had been largely ignored until the 1970s, the lack of fresh water being the real inhibitor to development. The Navy had built an 18-inch pipeline in 1942 that ran the 130 miles from the Everglades wells in Florida City to Key West. The water took a week to travel the route. In 1982 the old pipe was replaced with a 36-inch pipe, increasing the quantity fourfold, providing indeed an oversupply of water and accelerating building and population growth. Oddly, the pipeline, as well as the construction of new bridges and wider roads, took place seven years after the state had designated Monroe County, which is the Keys, an "area of critical state concern" in an attempt to slow development (a perfectly nice word that unfortunately has been stolen away-undoubtedly while we were not looking-by the developers). In the 1980s realtors dressed up in wood rat costumes and organized motorcades and rallies to protest new state guidelines that would restrict development in the Keys. It's true. People who felt themselves endangered by environmental laws dressed up like the cotton mouse and the wood rat-present inhabitants of mangrove swamp and hammock--and, aroused by lawyers and politicians, made a long, noisy trip down the highway to Key West, where the governor was speaking, picking up additional incensed rat- and mouse-garbed people along the way. This was typical oddball Keys, but in this case, peculiarity had a threateningly modern and consumptive edge, which is familiarly Floridian. <br><br>W. C. Barron, the founder of Wall Street's Barron's, said early in this century that the only values in the state of Florida are the values created by man. This was how the state was perceived by the wealthy who came from elsewhere to exploit it. Florida, that splendid, subtle, once fabulous state, has been exploited, miscomprehended and misused, drained and diked, filled in and paved over. The values of man have been imposed with a vengeance. <br><br>Half of the historic Everglades is now farms, groves, and cities, and this marvelous ecosystem isn't working anymore. Over the last 50 years, 90 percent of the 'Glades' wading-bird population has been lost. To read the roll of its endangered species is heartbreaking. The reef is becoming increasingly stressed by sewage that flows quickly through the porous rock of the Keys and into the ocean, as well as by agricultural runoff from the mainland that gets dumped into Florida Bay from the Everglades. The rat-garbed protesters of the '80s recrudesced in the '90s as noisy foes of the National Marine Sanctuary, a designation conceived in 1990 that would protect and preserve the waters around the Keys, which need every bit of protection and preservation that they can get. <br><br>In 1996, in a nonbinding referendum, Keys residents voted 55 percent to 45 percent against the final Sanctuary plan. The plan had been five years in the making, during which time it underwent extensive public review. There were fears of a federal takeover, fears that people's property rights would be stripped away, despite the fact that the Sanctuary was intended to protect water-specifically 2,800 square miles of water from Key Largo to the Dry Tortugas. It was not designed to protect a pristine ecosystem, but rather as an emergency measure to prolong the life of an already impaired environment. Because of local public concerns, only one half of 1 percent of the Sanctuary waters have their use restricted-such as "no take" zones-compared with the original proposal of 14 percent. Even a half percent was too much sanctuary for the opponents who urged voters through print and radio ads not to "surrender." The Sanctuary, despite the local vote, was endorsed by the state and implemented. Its one half of 1 percent of restricted use survived further cuts and will be monitored as a research and replenishment preserve. <br><br>The bill is coming. It's not like the bill from a wonderful restaurant, Louie's, for example. It's not the bill for the lovely fresh snapper, the lovely wines, the lovely brownie with bourbon ice cream and caramel sauce at the lovely table beside the lovely sea. It's the bill for all our environmental mistakes of the past. The big bill. <br><br>"Keys" comes from the Spanish word cayos, for "little islands." The Keys are little, and they are fragile. They cannot sustain any more "dream houses" or "dream resorts." The sustaining dream is in the natural world-the world that each of us should respect, enjoy, and protect so that it may be enjoyed again-the world to which one can return and be refreshed. <br><br>Time passes. There are more of the many, and they want too much. What the traveler wants, of course, is not development but adventure, and this is still possible in the Keys. The Keys have always been different. May they remain that way. Here's to them.</p><h2>No Such Creature</h2><p>Tooling across the American southwest in their giant Winnebago, Max and his nephew, Owen, seem harmless enough, the actorly old fellow spouting Shakespeare like a faucet while his young charge trots him through select tourist destinations along the road. But appearances, as you might imagine, can be deceiving.<br><br>Old Max is actually a master thief, and young Owen's summer vacation is his careful apprenticeship in a life of crime. Pulling heists is scary enough, but ominous signs point to the alarming fact that The Subtractors are on their tail, criminal bogeymen who stop at nothing to steal from other thieves. The road trip soon turns into a chase, by turns comic and horrifying. The most disturbing twist: Owen's slow realization that the person he loves most in the world is the one who can do him the most harm.</p><p>Giles Blunt grew up in North Bay, Ontario, and is the author of the acclaimed crime fiction series featuring John Cardinal. The most recent Cardinal novel, <b>By the Time You Read This</b>, was a <i>Globe and Mail</i> Best Book and was nominated for the Duncan Lawrie Dagger, the most prestigious crime fiction award in the world. After spending twenty years in New York City, Giles Blunt now makes his home in Toronto.ONE<br><br>On a cool night in late June the traffic on Highway 101 was not heavy &#x2013; not for a Saturday night, anyway &#x2013; and moved along at a steady clip, people cruising out to restaurants or movies or to spend the evening with friends.<br><br>There was one car travelling north from the city &#x2013; a midnight blue Lexus. An old man was driving, his considerable belly pressed up against the steering wheel, and the passenger seat was only partially filled by a blade-thin boy who looked to be in his late teens.<br><br>As the Lexus rounded a curve, it broke away from the rest of the traffic and veered across an entire lane. A sharp left, and then it bounced into the parking lot of a gas station and made a swift circle so that it came around again, nose pointed toward the highway.<br><br>Inside the car, the boy took his hand from the dash, where it had been bracing him against becoming a highway statistic, and said, &#x201c;Would you mind telling me what that was all about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Final wardrobe check.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We already did that, Max. Why do we have to do it over again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your hide I&#x2019;m looking out for, Owen, me lad. You know I never give a thought to myself &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve been accused of it many times. &#x2018;Max,&#x2019; the doctor said to me &#x2013; cardiologist, I hasten to point out, knows a thing or two about this sorrowful organ we call the human heart. &#x2018;Max,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;the fact is you are suffering from magnacarditis. Your heart&#x2019;s too big. An albatross borne down by giant wings. You care too much for other people, and it&#x2019;s driving you to an early grave.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The only thing getting bigger on you,&#x201d; the boy said, &#x201c;is your gut, and if you had a decent doctor &#x2013; not that I believe you ever went to see a doctor &#x2013; he&#x2019;d tell you to cut back on the Guinness and the single malts, not to mention the hamburgers, the milkshakes and the shepherd&#x2019;s pie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It pains me to hear such cynicism from one so young.&#x201d; Max placed a hand over his heart as if to protect that overworked organ. &#x201c;The world is a barren, comfortless place when a seventeen-year-old &#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eighteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2013; when an eighteen-year-old addresses his mentor this way &#x2013; insulting the sage and learned man who&#x2019;s raised him up as his own and taught him everything he knows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know lots of stuff you didn&#x2019;t teach me. The capitals of Africa, the rivers of South America, how to calculate the area of an irregular surface.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trivia,&#x201d; Max said. &#x201c;Tell it to Roscoe. But you wound me, boy.&#x201d; He tapped a plump finger on his heart and sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a gentle creature, beset by a heartless teenager, no doubt an incipient gangbanger. You, of course, are a warlike American, whereas I remain your humble Warwickshire yeoman, and ever shall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to visit Warwick one day. I&#x2019;d love to hear from somebody other than you what you were like as a kid. I have a feeling they&#x2019;ll be telling a very different story about Max Maxwell over there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonsense. They would recall a heroic figure, just as you see me today.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy examined himself in the rear�view mirror. &#x201c;Okay, so how do I look?&#x201d;<br><br>Max squinted at him, ginger eyebrows furrowing. &#x201c;Terrifying. Perfect young Republican.&#x201d;<br><br>They had decided on a dark wig and vigorous curls for Owen, and neatly trimmed sideburns. A gorgeous black Armani jacket and pants were set off by an expensive white T-shirt that showed off his fat�free abdominals. Owen&#x2019;s first draft of the look had been red hair, freckles and polka-dot bow tie, but Max overruled him: too on-the-nose, he called it, a parody. And besides, it was important to make optimal use of Owen&#x2019;s heartthrob potential. The curls did give the boy&#x2019;s profile a touch of the Greek god, not that Owen believed that heartthrob business for one minute.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think the hair&#x2019;s too curly?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect. Gives you a bit of the Kennedy &#x2013; to which even the most granite-hearted Republican is not immune. And me?&#x201d; Max smoothed his ginger moustache. Even up close it looked completely natural.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say you were a real bastard. Kind of guy who owns several mines and seriously mistreats his workers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Max, I bought you a little present.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No time, boy, no time.&#x201d; Max started the car again. &#x201c;We must get a wiggle on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hang on. You&#x2019;re gonna love this.&#x201d; Owen pulled it from an inside pocket and held it out.<br><br>&#x201c;A cellphone?&#x201d; Max furrowed his new ginger brows. &#x201c;Why in the name of heaven would we need another cellphone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t. Try to make a call from your cell.&#x201d;<br><br>Max gunned the motor, eyeing the traffic whizzing by. &#x201c;Owen, time is of the essence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got plenty of time. Try to make a call.&#x201d;<br><br>Muttering, Max extracted his cellphone and dialed Owen&#x2019;s number. &#x201c;Nothing happening,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Completely dead.&#x201d; He showed the tiny blank screen to Owen.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Owen said. &#x201c;Because what I have here is not a cellphone. It&#x2019;s a cellphone <i>jammer</i>. Good for up to five hundred yards.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You actually found one?&#x201d; Max said. &#x201c;Sweet boy, you are my very Ariel.&#x201d;<br><br>Owen put on a thin, reedy voice &#x2013; he was good at voices, and this one made him sound like a tiny alien. &#x201c;<i>All hail, great master! I come to answer thy best pleasure, be it to fly, to swim, to dive into the fire!</i>&#x201d;<br><br>Max laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good lad, Owen. Truly, it&#x2019;s not every boy who&#x2019;s cut out for a life of crime.&#x201d;<br><br>The old man slid the gear shift into drive and the Lexus eased back onto a highway peopled with innocent civilians.<br>TWO<br><br>The home of Margot Peabody was lit up like a Chinese lantern, all four storeys of it, a beacon to the rich, the Republican and the reprobate. It was an ornate wooden structure located in the most exclusive segment of Belvedere, purchased by pulp and paper magnate Cyrus Peabody (now defunct) some ten years previously for a comparative song. Expensive automobiles gleamed in a semicircle of driveway, their uniformed drivers absorbed in the sports pages.<br><br>Owen&#x2019;s usual stage fright kicked up a notch.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna be coming right back out,&#x201d; Max said to the teenager directing traffic. His accent was now American, a touch of the East Coast in it, but not much. &#x201c;Put us somewhere we can make a fast getaway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure thing, sir. Just park it over there under that tree. I won&#x2019;t let anyone block you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First class, kid.&#x201d; Max handed him a rolled-up bill. &#x201c;First class.&#x201d;<br><br>At the door they were met by an Asian houseboy in white livery. His hair was so slick, his skin so flawless, he looked as if he had escaped from a waxworks.<br><br>&#x201c;Good evening, sir. What name shall I say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Carter and Christopher Gould, but it&#x2019;s hardly worth the bother,&#x201d; Max said, &#x201c;we can&#x2019;t stay.&#x201d;<br><br>In the vast cathedral of space before them, men in dinner jackets mingled with well-tended women too thin for their hairdos. Owen looked up at the beautiful redwood beams supporting a ceiling that had to be at least forty feet high, but Max had taught him never to comment on such things, to act as if he took luxury and service for granted. Under massive skylights, a redwood mezzanine ran around the entire great hall.<br><br>The butterflies in Owen&#x2019;s stomach took flight up into his chest. But he loved this moment, this sense of balancing on the edge of the high dive, poised to plunge into triumph or disaster. It would be a hard thing to leave behind.<br><br>&#x201c;Turn around, kid,&#x201d; Max said to the houseboy. &#x201c;Just let me use your shoulder, I&#x2019;ll write a cheque right now and we&#x2019;ll be out of your hair.&#x201d;<br><br>The houseboy obligingly turned, tilting his head slightly, and Max whipped out a chequebook.<br><br>&#x201c;This state has had a Republican government for nearly eight years and I want to make sure it stays that way. Twenty thousand should help. If it was legal to give more, I&#x2019;d do it in a shot. Carter, your turn.&#x201d;<br><br>Owen pulled out a chequebook and wrote out a similar figure, signing it Carter P. Gould with a flourish.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, where do we drop these?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the large bottle by the stairs, sir, but I must tell Ms. Peabody you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Relax, kid, put your feet up. Margot!&#x201d;<br><br>Max waved to a woman just emerging from the crowd in an ivory summer dress tied at the waist.

Allen Jr. (2009-11-10)</h2><p>One of the world&#x2019;s foremost religion journalists offers an unexpected and provocative look at where the Catholic Church is headed&#x2014;and what the changes will mean for all of us. What will the Catholic Church be like in 100 years?</p><p>JOHN L. ALLEN, Jr., is the Vatican correspondent for the <i>National Catholic Reporter</i> and a Vatican analyst for CNBN and National Public Radio. He is the author of <i>Conclave</i>, <i>All the Pope&#x2019;s Men</i>, and <i>Opus Dei, </i>and writes the weekly Internet column, &#x201c;The Word from Rome.&#x201d; He lives in New York City and Rome.In Thomas Friedman&#x2019;s enormously popular book about globalization, he summarized the essential message in four words: the world is flat. Globalization is knocking down one barrier to opportunity after another, creating a world in which smart, hungry go- getters in India, China, or Brazil can compete not just for the low- wage jobs Americans don&#x2019;t want, but for the hightech, high- pay jobs they definitely do want. For that reason, Friedman&#x2019;s book came with a warning: Americans need to hustle in this century or they&#x2019;ll find themselves run over by this phenomenon.<br>This too is a book about globalization. Its subject is the oldest globalized institution on earth, the Roman Catholic Church. Its bottom line can also be expressed in a few words: the church is upside down. By that, I don&#x2019;t mean that the Church is topsy- turvy or out of whack. I mean that the issues, party lines, and ways of doing business that have dominated Catholicism in the forty- plus years since the close of the Second Vatican Council in 1965, that watershed moment in modern Catholic life, are being turned on their head by a series of new forces reshaping the global Church. This book comes with a warning too: Catholics in the twenty- first century won&#x2019;t just need hustle (though they certainly will need that), but above all they&#x2019;ll need imagination. They&#x2019;ll need the capacity to reconsider how they think about the Church, and what they do with their faith, because otherwise Catholicism won&#x2019;t rise to the occasion of these new challenges&#x2014; it&#x2019;ll be steamrolled by them.<br><br>Consider the following ways in which the Catholic Church is upside down in the twenty- first century:<br>� A Church dominated in the twentieth century by the global North, meaning Europe and North America, today finds two thirds of its members living in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Catholic leadership will come from all over the world in this century to a degree never before experienced.<br>� A Church whose watchword after the Second Vatican Council (1962&#x2013; 65) was <i>aggiornamento, </i>meaning &#x201c;opening up to the modern world,&#x201d; is today officially cutting in the opposite direction, reaffirming everything that makes Catholicism different from modernity. This politics of identity is in part a reaction against runaway secularization.<br>� A Church whose primary interreligious relationship for the last forty years has been with Judaism now finds itself struggling to come to terms with a newly assertive Islam, not just in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, but in its own European backyard.<br>� A Church that has historically invested a large share of its pastoral energy in the young now has to cope, beginning in the North, with the most rapidly aging population in human history.<br>� A Church that has long relied on its clergy to deliver pastoral care and to provide leadership now has lay people doing both in record numbers and in a staggering variety of ways.<br>� A Church used to debating bioethical issues that have been around for millennia&#x2014; abortion, birth control, and homosexuality&#x2014; finds itself in a brave new world of cloning, ge ne tic enhancements, and trans- species chimeras. Its moral teaching is struggling desperately to keep pace with scientific advances.<br>� A Church whose social teaching took shape in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution now faces a twenty- first- century globalized world, populated by strange entities such as multinational corporations<br>(MNCs) and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) that didn&#x2019;t exist when it crafted its vision of the just society.<br>� A Church whose social concern focuses almost exclusively on human beings finds itself in a world in which the welfare of the cosmos itself requires new theological and moral reflection.<br>� A Church whose diplomacy has always relied on the Great Catholic Power of the day is now moving in a multipolar world, in which most of the poles that matter aren&#x2019;t Catholic, and some aren&#x2019;t even Christian.<br>� A Church accustomed to thinking of the Christian &#x201c;other&#x201d; as the Orthodox, Anglicans, and Protestants today is watching Pentecostals march across the planet, shooting up from 5 to 20 percent of global Christianity in barely a quarter century&#x2014; in part by siphoning off significant numbers of Catholics. The Catholic Church is itself being &#x201c;Pentecostalized&#x201d; through the Charismatic movement.<br><br>An old car commercial carried the tagline, &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t your grandfather&#x2019;s Buick.&#x201d; I would submit that what we&#x2019;re looking at today isn&#x2019;t your mom and dad&#x2019;s Catholic Church&#x2014; and it may not even be your older sister&#x2019;s. The aim of this book is to survey the most important currents shaping the Catholic Church today, and to look down the line at how they might play out during the rest of the twenty- first century. The word I&#x2019;m using to describe these currents is &#x201c;trend.&#x201d; To explain what I have in mind, let me quote the historian Arnold J. Toynbee from his book <i>Civilization on Trial</i>:<br><br>The things that make good headlines are on the surface of the stream of life, and they distract us from the slower, impalpable, imponderable movements that work below the surface and penetrate to the depths. But it is really these deeper, slower movements that make history, and it is they that stand out huge in retrospect, when the sensational passing events have dwindled, in perspective, to their true proportions.<br><br>Those &#x201c;slower, impalpable movements&#x201d; are what I mean by &#x201c;trends.&#x201d; (I lay out the six criteria I employed for what counts as a trend in the chapter on &#x201c;Trends that Aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;) In several cases, there are plenty of headlines associated with one or another aspect of the trends, but usually they&#x2019;re treated in isolation, as random events, rather than being seen as part of deeper historical patterns. I hope to put the pieces of the contemporary Catholic puzzle together, so we can see what the picture looks like.<br><br>Each of the examples of an upside- down Church given above corresponds to one of the ten trends surveyed in this book:<br>1. A World Church<br>2. Evangelical Catholicism<br>3. Islam<br>4. The New Demography<br>5. Expanding Lay Roles<br>6. The Biotech Revolution<br>7. Globalization<br>8. Ecology<br>9. Multipolarism<br>10. Pentecostalism<br><br>The ten chapters of the book correspond to the ten trends listed above. They are not listed in order of rank or priority, as if number one were more important than number ten. To be completely honest, the sequence simply reflects the order in which I wrote the chapters. No additional significance should be attached to why one trend is number two, for example, and another number eight. The format in each chapter is to give the lay of the land first, examining what&#x2019;s driving the trend and what impact it&#x2019;s having on the Catholic Church, in a section called &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Happening.&#x201d; I then move into more speculative territory, trying to anticipate what the trend could mean for the Church as the century unfolds. That part is called &#x201c;What It Means.&#x201d; These are not really predictions, but possible lines of development that could still be redirected, blocked, or turned in the opposite direction by forces not yet on the radar screen. In each chapter, I offer four categories of outcomes: near- certain, probable, possible, and long shots. Not only does the degree of probability go down with each category, but the projections venture farther out in time. Near- certain consequences are usually short- term extensions of developments that we can already see happening. Long shots, if they happen at all, are usually far on the horizon. The arc of time under consideration here is the rest of the century, meaning roughly ninety years. Farther out than that, all bets are off. <br>The book&#x2019;s conclusion is intended as a stand- alone summary of what impact the trends will have in the century to come. I condense the likely profile of upside- down Catholicism into four points. They&#x2019;re styled as sociological notes of the Church in the twenty- first century, inspired by the theological notes in the Nicene Creed: &#x201c;One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic.&#x201d; My notes are intended not as theological claims about the Church&#x2019;s inner essence, but rather as descriptive terms for what Catholicism will actually look and feel like in this century. The four notes are: &#x201c;Global, Uncompromising, Pentecostal, and Extroverted.&#x201d; Readers who just can&#x2019;t wait to arrive at the bottom line may want to read the conclusion first, then work backward.<br><i><br>Descriptive, not Prescriptive<br></i>It&#x2019;s important to be clear at the outset about what this book is and what it&#x2019;s not. I&#x2019;m a journalist, not a priest, theologian, or academic. My role is to document what&#x2019;s happening in Catholicism and to provide context for it, not tell readers what to think. This book is therefore an exercise in description, not prescription. I&#x2019;m not trying to argue that these trends are the way Catholicism <i>ought </i>to go, or the issues it <i>ought </i>to face. I&#x2019;m saying instead that they accurately express the way Catholicism <i>really is </i>going, and the issues it <i>really is </i>facing. I invite readers to bracket off the immediate instinct to debate whether any given trend is positive or negative, and to try to understand it first on its own terms. After that, I entrust the prescriptive debate to better minds than my own. I stress this point because in writing about these trends, I find that many Catholics immediately want to challenge one or another of them on prescriptive grounds: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think evangelical Catholicism is what Vatican Two had in mind,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Ecology is just another word for pagan pantheism.&#x201d; I understand those reactions. Religion is about someone&#x2019;s ultimate concern, their deepest passion, and naturally Catholic blood boils when someone says the Church is moving in direction &#x201c;x,&#x201d; if a given Catholic happens to regard &#x201c;x&#x201d; as obtuse, or heretical, or reactionary. In principle, that kind of argument is terrific. Part of the dynamism of Catholicism is that so many people help keep the Church alive by being passionate enough to push the Church to realize the best version of itself. To move immediately to forming opinions, however, is to miss the point of what I&#x2019;m trying to do here. There will be time later to argue whether a given trend is a good idea or a bad one. For that sort of prescriptive debate to be useful, it first has to be based on solid analysis, and that&#x2019;s the work of this book.<br>In a similar vein, because this book is a work of journalism, it is not a statement of faith. I&#x2019;m trying to describe the Church the way a sociologist might. I fully recognize that from a supernatural point of view, the lone trend that matters in Catholic life is God&#x2019;s will for the Church, which can always erupt in unpredictable ways. On this level, decisions about the Catholic future are forged not in dispassionate so cio log i cal analysis, but out of deep prayer and the spiritual effort to discern where the Holy Spirit is moving. Yet the Catholic understanding, put in its classic form in the thirteenth century by Saint Thomas Aquinas, is that grace builds on nature, it doesn&#x2019;t replace it. In other words, the descriptive observations about human realities in the Church offered here may not be the whole story, but they are nonetheless important preliminaries for spiritual reflection. They offer fruit for Catholic prayer, without any pretense of rendering it unnecessary. In the interest of full disclosure, I should confess that I veer into prescriptive territory in the book&#x2019;s conclusion&#x2014; not in terms of whether these trends are good or bad, but rather in urging Catholics to think and act in new ways in order to adapt successfully to this &#x201c;upside- down&#x201d; situation. This is one final point of resemblance between my book and Friedman&#x2019;s <i>The World is Flat</i>. Friedman&#x2019;s list of drivers shaping a flat world is basically descriptive, but he&#x2019;s unabashedly enthusiastic about globalization. Similarly, I make no bones about my sympathy for Catholicism. I want to see the Church harness its resources to respond to the perils and promise of the twenty- first century, because I believe Catholicism has a potentially transformative contribution to offer that no other global actor can replicate. I don&#x2019;t pretend to know how to accomplish this, but I think I know how <i>not </i>to do it, which is to allow the Church&#x2019;s resources and energy to be consumed in stale internal debates. Tribalism will not be an adaptive behavior in the twenty- first- century Church.<br>I suppose I&#x2019;m trying to strike a balance between leaving readers free to decide what to think, but at the same time encouraging them to think big. Maybe a quick story will help explain the difference. Some time ago, I spent an afternoon discussing these trends with a couple hundred priests and pastoral workers in the Archdiocese of Seattle, at the invitation of Archbishop Alex Brunett. After I had finished, Brunett got up and told the crowd that in his opinion, an outlook he called &#x201c;Trends Catholicism&#x201d; offers a &#x201c;hopeful vision for the future of the Church.&#x201d; I was a bit taken aback, since my intent was to describe trends, not to create one of my own. I wondered if I had gone off track someplace, and was now coming off as a prophet or reformer rather than a journalist. Upon reflection, however, I think I know what Archbishop Brunett meant. Reading about these trends won&#x2019;t tell you who&#x2019;s right or wrong in Church debates, but it does point to a broader horizon than the narrow set that is often seen as &#x201c;issues in the Church.&#x201d; This book may not be prescriptive, but it is an invitation to perspective.<br><i><br>How Do I Know?<br></i>The ten trends described in this book are not like the Ten Commandments; they weren&#x2019;t revealed by God, and I didn&#x2019;t bring them down from a mountain carved on stone tablets. The Vatican does not issue an official set of Catholic Trends, and there&#x2019;s no international Catholic research agency that has established such a list. No international Catholic publication that I&#x2019;m aware of puts out such a list either. So, it&#x2019;s a perfectly fair reaction to look at the list I provided above and ask: &#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;<br><br>The truth is that compiling a list of trends in Catholicism is a subjective enterprise. My guess is that out of any ten Catholics you might pick at random and ask to name the most important forces shaping the future of the Church, not one of them would come up with exactly the same list presented here. That&#x2019;s part of the fun, since anyone is free to argue that some items on the list shouldn&#x2019;t be there, and that other things should be included that aren&#x2019;t. Yet I didn&#x2019;t just throw darts at a dart board, picking these ten forces at random. They&#x2019;re based on more than a de cade of day- in, day- out analysis of the global Church. Let me briefly describe the three sources that have most influenced my decisions.<br><br>First is my experience of covering the Vatican and the global Church. Over the last decade, I&#x2019;ve made reporting trips to forty countries on every continent, sometimes following the pope and sometimes on my own. I&#x2019;ve had the opportunity to observe the Church in a variety of cultural, ethnic, socioeconomic, and po liti cal circumstances. Over time, that experience has given me a feel for what&#x2019;s circulating in the global Catholic bloodstream, as opposed to something likely to be a transitory and local affair. I certainly don&#x2019;t claim infallibility, but I&#x2019;ve been lucky to be able to move around the Catholic world and to occupy a front- row seat for many of its recent dramas in a way that few other people have had the opportunity to do.<br><br>Second, I&#x2019;m relying on thousands of hours of interviews with cardinals, bishops and priests, and even popes, as well as theologians, politi cal activists, social workers, liturgical experts, leaders in ecumenical dialogue, and virtually every other species of life in the Catholic biosphere.

The only cure lies within a remedy book, lost long ago. <br> <br>Determined to save Nona, Sabine goes to Pine City to visit a distant relative who may have clues. But there's someone else clamoring for Sabine's attention: a fifty-year-old ghost named Chloe who's been appearing in her dreams. Celebrated by Pine City every year on the anniversary of her tragic death, Chloe has become a town legend. Despite death threats and missing the school dance, Sabine must use her psychic skills to solve the mystery surrounding Chloe's untimely demise . . . and lay her soul to rest.</p></p><p>With plots involving twins, cheerleaders, ghosts, psychics and clones, Linda Joy Singleton has published over 25 midgrade and YA books. <br> <br>When she's not writing, she enjoys life in the country with a barnyard of animals including horses, cats, dogs and pigs. She especially loves to hear from readers and speaking at schools and libraries. She collects vintage series books like Nancy Drew, Trixie Belden and Judy Bolton. <br> <br>When Linda is asked why she'd rather write for kids than adults, she says, "I love seeing the world through the heart of a child, where magic is real and every day begins a new adventure. I hope to inspire them to reach for their dreams. Writing for kids is a gift, a responsibility, and an honor." <br> <br>Grade 6-8-Sabine, the teen whose psychic visions caused uproar at her high school in <i>Don't Die, Dragonfly</i> (Llewellyn, 2004), is back. This time, she travels with her new goth friend to Pine Peaks, CA, to procure an old remedy book that may save her grandmother's life. Even before the trip, a dancing girl named Chloe who falls off of a cliff haunts the protagonist's dreams. Once Sabine and Thorn arrive in Pine Peaks, the haunting becomes more vivid and urgent, causing Sabine to realize that she must help this lonely ghost rest in peace. This diversion has closure by the end, but the original reason for the quest is left open-ended for the next installment. While rather slow at the beginning, the pace quickens after a few short chapters, revealing a novel that is simple yet interesting enough to recommend to reluctant readers. The story itself, as well as most of the writing, is average for its genre, although a few sections are quite poetic and help reinforce the eerie mood.

He begins his investigation as a driver for the antiestablishment Mellow Yellow Cab Co.--although most passengers are anonymous and often inebriated, he encounters rock group Fleetwood Mac, who sit in his icy taxi as he flags down a truck for a jump start. Conover misses no chance for Aspen's version of enlightenment: He crashes an exclusive party for actor Don Johnson; delightedly acquires Jack Nicholson's ski mask when the actor forgets it at a restaurant; visits too-agreeable singer John Denver, whose sentimentality is mercilessly satirized by locals; and meets gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson. Eventually he signs on as a reporter for the Aspen Times and is nearly seduced by the town, donning trendy recreational gear and looking askance at Denver, Aspen's plebian neighbor. Disillusionment sets in, however, as he researches Aspen's exorbitantly priced and exceedingly popular New Age retreats, witnesses the dangers of outdoor adventure, learns about escalating real estate values and notices numerous reformed idealists. Low-key, objective and unpretentious, Conover avoids cynicism, letting Aspen's events and individuals speak for themselves. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kitchen Table Bird Book</h2><p>The birds depicted in this book are arranged according to size, moving from the smallest birds in the front of the book to the largest at the back. Size here is determined by body length alone, and you&#39;ll see that measurement, in inches printed in the upper right corner on each of the plates. We believe this is to provide the simplest means of finding in this book any unknown bird that appears before you. Simply guess the bird&#39;s body length, then turn to that portion of the book showing birds of about that length. Once there, flipping pages back and forth in those approximate lengths should locate the bird for you readily. If you know the name of the bird, you can use the alphabetized index to species printed inside the back cover to locate the plate and information. This Kitchen Table Bird Book grew to publication over a period of three years, and changed form in that time gradually to fit what has seemed its most practical purpose - use by residents of our Great Lakes region who spend most of their bird-watching time at home, inside, looking out windows at feeding, bathing birds. The 77 species discussed and portrayed here represent the most common small birds that come to feeders, or which might land on marsh edge or lawn or woodlands of the type often seen from kitchen windows of this region. The companion Coat Pocket Bird Book contains another 80 species, most of which will be seen afield, but some of which may also come to your feeder. The placement of some species in one or the other of these books was in some cases arbitrarily decided, though our intention all along has been to provide one book for home use, one for field use. These two books were designed primarily for the casual, beginning, and intermediate birdwatcher, though we have been pleased by the positive reception given to the books by birding veterans with hundreds of species included on their &#34;&#34;life lists.&#34;&#34; In fact, we believe any birdwatcher, of whatever experience, will find these books valuable and useful reference works. Together, the two books do not include all the birds that visit, nest, or live year-round in this region, but the 157 species collectively represent, we estimate, 90-plus percent of all the millions of birds that will be seen here. Consequently, if you eventually do see all the species depicted in these books, you will be a birdwatching professional.</p><p>Jon Ham, the author of this book, taught school in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area for 38 years before retiring a few years back to watch, enjoy, and write about his favorite subject - backyard birds. Ham taught all school levels, from seventh grade through college, and admits that throughout his tenure he favored the subjects of nature, nature study, and natural history. His last 18 years were spent teaching zoology and ornithology at Grand Rapids Junior college. &#34;&#34;You might think, after teaching the subject of birds for so long, &#34;&#34; he writes, &#34;&#34;that I&#39;d want to get away from birding, but in fact the exact opposite has happened. My wife and I have our home located in a dense patch of woods near the village of Cascade, and it&#39;s an ideal location to watch the comings and goings of a great many bird species. What had been my profession in everyday life has become our central retirement interest.&#34;&#34; Ham is a registered bird-bander, and has held in his hand most of the birds he describes in this book. Most, in fact, have come to his feeders at one time or another, his backyard being a lively aviary at all seasons of the year. &#34;&#34;Just put out seeds, suet, and water in an environment safe from cats and dogs and you can be sure the birds will arrive. And with them comes the beginning of a lifelong interest.&#34;&#34; David P. Mohrhardt began drawing wildlife at an early age, and currently works full-time producing commission paintings, canvases for prints, and illustrations for publications, including the Kitchen Table Bird Book and its companion, the Coat Pocket Bird Book. Mohrhardt holds a degree in biology from Michigan State University, but admits he studied that subject mainly because of its help in his wildlife painting. He has worked as a staff member and exhibits preparator at a number of nature centers, museums, and universities. He has shown his work in many one-man and group shows, and holds a string of awards and honors for his paintings. He believes that wildlife painting is entering a new and freer expression, that the field holds great promise to blossom in the years ahead as an important and unique American art form.

Morrison, an atomic physicist.A triumphant reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes canon that identifies, once and for all, the great love of the detective's life. Detailed summary would wreck the inventive plot by unmasking its mysteries, which begin to unfold when Dr. Watson's 1922 announcement that he is writing a biography of his late friend brings a storm of threats and warnings against the project--two of them from Mycroft Holmes and a writer identifying herself as Mrs. John H. Watson. The disappearance and reappearance of a mysterious old mental patient called Nannerl leads Watson to a secret Holmes had kept even from him (a secret that someone is now determined to keep from coming to light): Holmes's fascination, dating back to his earliest years with Watson, with Victor Sigerson, the gifted violinist who gave the detective lessons back in 1886 and left him his prized Stradivarius in his will. By comparing his own notes on the Sigerson affair with Holmes's account in his diary, Watson uncovers the woman, code-named ``English Violet,'' with whom Holmes was secretly in love--the woman for whom he traveled that summer to the kingdom of Ludwig II in a futile diplomatic errand that placed both Holmes and Violet in danger. Where does all this leave Irene Adler, the woman of Holmes legend? Don't worry: Naslund (the story collection Ice Skating at the North Pole, 1989) calls on her to point the feminist moral of Holmes's romance in a magical epilogue. Despite some incredible flights of fancy in Ludwig's fairy-tale Bavaria: one of the very few Holmes pastiches that not only honors the great man's memory (compare Nicholas Meyer's slapdash The Canary Trainer, p. 821) but unleashes his residual mythic power for more ambitious purposes. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Of these, the 15th Missouri, comprised primarily of German immigrants, served the longest and suffered the highest percentage of battlefield casualties of all the Union regiments from Missouri. Yet very little source material is available about the 15th Missouri. German immigrants seldom wrote of their wartime experiences, and those who did wrote almost exclusively in German. A veteran of the regiment, Maurice Marcoot wrote the only known firsthand account of the 15th. Written years after the war, Marcoot&#x2019;s detailed chronicle of life in the 15th Missouri is the framework of <em>Long Road to Liberty.</em> Also using letters and diaries of Germans with other regiments, author Donald Allendorf expands on the experiences of the immigrant-soldiers&#x2015;how they felt about slavery and race and why they chose to fight.</p> <p><em>Long Road to Liberty</em> traces the men&#x2019;s immigrant roots and their involvement in events leading up to the war, including breaking up the last slave auction in St. Louis and efforts to keep Missouri in the Union, and continues with their army lives as the state&#x2019;s first volunteers. It details the 15th&#x2019;s actions in crucial battles in Tennessee and Georgia: their desperate stand at Stones River and near annihilation at Chickamauga; their charge without orders up Missionary Ridge; the campaign for Atlanta; and their role at Spring Hill and the killing field a day later at Franklin, Tennessee.</p> <p>They served almost five years, most of that time in daily contact with their Southern adversaries in Tennessee and Georgia. When the war was finally over, more than half of the 904 officers and men who had ever served with the 15th regiment had been wounded or killed, while another 107 died of disease.</p> <p>Historians and Civil War buff s alike will find <em>Long Road to Liberty</em> a welcome addition to the literature of the war in the western theater.</p></p><p><strong>Donald Allendorf,</strong> a journalism graduate of the University of Missouri, spent 40 years in communications and journalism and was the director of marketing communications and research at the Gates Corporation in Denver.

So when a stranger comes to Fox River who isn&#x2019;t a stranger to anyone but him, he has to rely on his prying housekeeper to tell him that the mystery man is actually a well-known murderer. Ten years ago, Nathaniel Green&#x2019;s wife was dying of cancer, and after a short remission she relapsed into a coma. That small sliver of hope so utterly dashed must have been too much for him because when the nurses came to check on her they found that he had taken her off of her life support. Green&#x2019;s return divides the community, but the more Father Dowling ponders the moral questions and reinvestigates the case, the more he wonders if Green committed any crime at all.<br><br>With parishioners up in arms, Father Dowling has to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that a conviction is no proof of guilt in <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, the newest addition to Ralph McInerny&#x2019;s acclaimed and beloved mystery series.</p></p><p>RALPH MCINERNY has authored more than forty books, including his popular mystery series set at the University of Notre Dame, where he has taught for more than fifty years and is the director of the Jacques Maritain Center. The recipient of the Bouchercon Lifetime Achievement Award, he has also been appointed to the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. He lives in South Bend, Indiana.Chapter One <br>"Remember, man, that thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return." <p></p>Father Dowling murmured this formula as he traced a cross on the foreheads of the old people who advanced up the middle aisle of St. Hilary&#x2019;s on this Ash Wednesday. Remember, man. No feminist had ever objected to this inclusive term, perhaps wanting to think of it as gender specific. Like All men are mortal? <p></p>It was the rheumy eye of Monica Garvey staring into his as he applied ashes to her forehead that prompted these irreverent thoughts. Monica was known to complain about the Church&#x2019;s treatment of women, thereby earning the friendly enmity of Marie Murkin, the parish housekeeper. Monica turned and made way for the next penitent. Roger Dowling switched to the Latin formula when Kevin Brown stood before him, eyes closed, head thrust forward. <p></p>"Memento homo quia pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris." <p></p>Kevin&#x2019;s lips moved as he repeated the words silently. Kevin had given Father Dowling a subscription to the magazine Latin Mass at Christmas, and the first issue had arrived some weeks before. Father Dowling said Vatican II&#x2019;s Novus Ordo in Latin once a week, on Mondays, and the attendance noticeably rose. <p></p>"Why only once a week, Father?" Kevin asked. <p></p>"After years of English it takes some getting used to." <p></p>"People love it." <p></p>It was partly nostalgia, of course. There were few people who, like Kevin Brown, understood Latin. He had studied it as a boy at Quigley when he had thought of becoming a priest. But he had gone on to Loyola and then to law school, prospered, married, had half a dozen disappointing children about whose souls he now fretted. "Thank God, Bridget never saw how they turned out." It seemed that none of them went to Mass anymore. With Kevin there might have been an element of affectation in his championing the return to Latin in the liturgy. A pharisee thanking God he was not like the rest of men? That was unfair. Kevin seemed to think that it was the Church&#x2019;s dropping of Latin that had led to the falling away of his children. <p></p>Father Dowling finished distributing ashes and went into the sacristy feeling that his Lent was off on the wrong foot. Uncharitable thoughts, first about Monica and then about Kevin. God knows he had few aggravations in his pastoral work. Other pastors had to contend with the uprising of laypeople, women lectors who altered the Scriptures as they read, male clerical wannabes hovering about the pastor, a platoon of aids called ministers. Father Dowling realized he was in charge at St. Hilary&#x2019;s as others longed to be in charge of their own parishes. A mild feminist and a man who missed the Latin of his youth scarcely added up to a cross. Most of those who had been to the noon Mass and stayed for the distribution of ashes would now return to the parish center in the former school. <p></p>A man shuffled into the sacristy, a smudge of ashes on his forehead. Father Dowling remembered him; he had been the last in line. <p></p>"I hope it was all right, Father." He pointed to his forehead. <p></p>"Why wouldn&#x2019;t it be?" The man had not come to communion. Did he think he must confess before receiving ashes? <p></p>"I&#x2019;m not a Catholic, Father." <p></p>"Ah." <p></p>"I meant no disrespect." <p></p>"It&#x2019;s perfectly all right," Father Dowling said. "It&#x2019;s not a sacrament. Just a reminder of our mortality as Lent begins." <p></p>"Quite a turnout." <p></p>Father Dowling guessed him to be in his late sixties, maybe more. His complexion was colorless and seemed paler because of his white hair. <p></p>"Most of them came over from the parish center. You might want to look into it." <p></p>The man seemed puzzled, so Father Dowling explained the use to which he had put the school when there were no longer enough kids in the parish to justify keeping it open. <p></p>"What is it exactly?" the man asked. <p></p>"Look, come have lunch with me. Mrs. Murkin doesn&#x2019;t like me to be late." <p></p>"Mrs.?" <p></p>"The housekeeper." <p></p>"I don&#x2019;t want to intrude." <p></p>Father Dowling said, "She likes it when I ask people to join me." She liked anyone with an appetite greater than his. On the way to the rectory he asked the man his name and so was able to announce it when they passed through the kitchen. <p></p>"Mr. Green, Marie. Nathaniel Green. He has agreed to have lunch with me." <p></p>Marie harumphed. "On Ash Wednesday? Some treat." <p></p>"I&#x2019;m not Catholic," Green said. <p></p>Marie gave him the fish eye. "I made no provisions for that. You&#x2019;ll have to fast and abstain with Father Dowling." <p></p>Marie made it sound like bread and water. But it was a broiled white fish and mixed vegetables, peas and corn, that Marie put before them. <p></p>"I was telling Mr. Green about the parish center, Marie." <p></p>"You retired?" Marie asked their guest. <p></p>Green smiled. "Is that a requirement?" <p></p>"No," she said, "and you don&#x2019;t have to be Catholic, either. Many of them will be older than you." <p></p>Marie&#x2019;s manner with Green was brisk and oddly distant. She swept into the kitchen; the door swung to and fro and then stopped. <p></p>"I have been in a rectory before," Nathaniel Green said. "Before I married." <p></p>"You married a Catholic?" Father Dowling said. <p></p>"I used to be a Catholic myself." <p></p>"Did you get tired of it?" A light note seemed best, given the way Green had introduced the subject. <p></p>"After her death, I just let it go." <p></p>Father Dowling nodded. Every life had its tragedies, sooner or later. <p></p>"I gather that wasn&#x2019;t recently," he said. <p></p>"No." "And now you&#x2019;ve come back." <p></p>"You make it sound easy." <p></p>No need to press it now. If Green had come to church on Ash Wednesday, that might mean something, and then again it might not. <p></p>"Why don&#x2019;t you let Marie take you over to the parish center and introduce you around?" <p></p>"Oh, I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;s too busy," Green protested. <p></p>From the kitchen came a voice. "Give me five minutes and I&#x2019;ll take him over." <p></p>Excerpted from Ash Wednesday by Ralph McInerny <p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Ralph McInerny <p></p>Published in 2008 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Minotaur <p></p>All rights reserved.

Using sources on both sides of the Atlantic and personally interviewing many of those who fought at the wood, Asprey combines excitement with detail and accuracy in telling of this major battle of World War I. He describes the hardships, the combination of tactical ingenuity and pure guts which ultimately enabled Major Maurice Shearer to report to Brigadier General Harbord on June 26th, &#x201c;Belleau Wood now U.S. Marine Corps entirely.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in print after many years&#x2014;first time in paperback.</p><p>On June 15, 1918, the 2nd U.S. Division--consisting of army soldiers and combat-ready troops recruited from the Marine Corps by General Pershing to supplement limited American forces--met with their German opponents at Belleau Wood. At the time, Allied spirits were extremely low; the question was not <i>if</i> the Germans would march into Paris, but <i>when</i>. But the 2nd fought hard and pulled out a victory, and created the psychological turning point that allowed the Allies to end the war by year's end. Military historian Robert Asprey tells this rousing tale with much first-hand testimony (in interviews, memoirs, and letters home) from the troops that made it happen.8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Everything&#39;s an Argument, 7th edition, UTA</h2><p>Everything&#39;s an Argument teaches students to analyze the arguments that surround them every day and to create their own.

They intend to start a men� s club, the purpose of which isn� t immediately clear to any of them; but very quickly they discover a powerful and passionate desire to talk. First published in 1981, <i>The Men� s Club </i>is a scathing, pitying, absurdly dark and funny novel about manhood in the age of therapy. � The climax is fitting, horrific, and wonderfully droll� (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).</p><p><b>Leonard Michaels&nbsp;</b>(1933&#x2013;2003) was the author of five collections of stories and essays&#x2014;<i>Going Places</i>, <i>I Would Have Saved Them If I Could</i>, <i>Shuffle</i>, <i>A Girl with a Monkey</i>, and <i>To Feel These Things</i>&#x2014;as well as two novels, <i>Sylvia </i>and <i>The Men&#x2019;s Club</i>. All of his fiction will be reissued as FSG Classics.<b>The Men's Club</b><br><b>ONE</b>Women wanted to talk about anger, identity, politics, etc. I saw posters in Berkeley urging them to join groups. I saw their leaders on TV. Strong, articulate faces. So when Cavanaugh phoned and invited me to join a men's club, I laughed. Slowly, not laughing, he repeated himself. He was six foot nine. The size and weight entered his voice. He and some friends wanted a club. "A regular social possibility outside of our jobs and marriages. Nothing to do with women's groups." One man was a tax accountant, another was a lawyer. There was also a college teacher like me and two psychotherapists. Solid types. I supposed there could be virtues in a men's club, a regular socialpossibility. I should have said yes immediately, but something in me resisted. The prospect of leaving my house after dinner to go to a meeting. Blood is heavy then. Brain is slow. Besides, wasn't this club idea corny? Like trying to recapture high-school days. Locker-room fun. Wet naked boys snapping towels at each other's genitals. It didn't feel exactly right. To be wretchedly truthful, any social possibility unrelated to wife, kids, house, and work felt like a form of adultery. Not criminal. Not legitimate."Cavanaugh, I don't even go to the movies anymore.""I'm talking about a men's club. Good company. You talk about women's groups. Movies. Can't you hear me?""When the phone rings, it's like an attack on my life. I get confused. Say it again.""Listen to me, man. You're one of my best friends. You live less than a mile away, but do we see each other three times a year? When is the last time we talked to each other, really talked?""I lose over a month a year just working to pay property taxes. Friendship is a luxury. Unless you're so poor it makes no difference how you spend your time.""A men's club. Good company.""I hear you."But I was thinking about good company. Some of my married colleagues had love affairs, usually with students. You could call it a regular social possibility. It included emotional chaos. Gonorrhea. Even guilt. They would have been better off in a men's club."What do you say? Can we expect you?""I'll go to the first meeting. I can't promise more. I'm very busy.""Yeah, yeah," said Cavanaugh and gave me an address in the Berkeley flats. A man named Harry Kramer lived there. I was to look for a redwood fence and pine trees.&nbsp;<br>The night of the meeting I told my wife I'd be home early. Before midnight, certainly. I had to teach the next day. She said, "Take out the garbage." Big sticky bag felt unpropitious and my hands soon smelled of tuna fish. After driving only five minutes, I found the place.The front of the house, vine-covered, seemed to brood in lunatic privacy. Nobody answered when I knocked, but I heard voices, took hold of a wroughtiron handle and pushed, discovering a large Berkeley living room and five men inside. I saw dark wood paneling and potted ferns dangling from exposed beams. Other plants along the window ledges. A pottedtree in a far corner, skinny, spinsterish-looking. Nervous yellow leaves filled its head. Various ceramics, bowls on tabletops and plates on the walls beside large acrylic paintings, abstractions like glistening viscera splashed off a butcher block. Also an amazing rug, but I couldn't take it in. A man was rising from a pillow, coming toward me, smiling."I knocked," I said."Come in, man. I'm Harry Kramer.""I'm Cavanaugh's friend.""Who isn't?""Really," I said, giving it the L.A. inflection to suggest sympathetic understanding, not wonder. Kramer registered the nuance and glanced at me as at a potential brother.His heavy black hair was controlled by a style, parted in the middle and shaped to cup his ears in a way that once belonged to little girls. It was contradicted by black force in his eyes, handshake like a bite, and tattooed forearms. Blue, winged snake. Blue dagger amid roses. They spoke for an earlier life, I supposed, but Kramer wore his sleeves rolled to the elbow. It was hard to connect him with his rug, which I began to appreciate as spongy and orange. I felt myself wading and bouncing through it as Kramer led me toward the men.Shaking hands, nodding hello, saying my name, each man was a complex flash--eyes, hand, name --but one had definition. He was graphic; instantly closer to me than the others. Solly Berliner. Tall, skinny, wearing a suit. Dead-white hair and big greenish light in his eyes. The face of an infant surprised by senility. His suit was gray polyester, conservative and sleazy. Kramer left me with Berliner beside the potted tree, a beer in my hand. A man about five foot six or seven came right up to us. "Care for a taste?" In his palm lay two brown marijuanas, slick with spittle. I declined. Berliner said, "Thanks, thanks," with frightening gratitude, and took both cigarettes. We laughed. Then he dropped one back into the man's palm. Turning toward the others, the man said, "Anyone care for a taste?"The sound of Berliner's voice lingered after the joke; loud, impulsive. Maybe he felt uneasy. Out of his natural environment. I couldn't guess where that might be. He was a confusion of clues. The suit wasn't Berkeley. The eyes were worlds of feeling. His speedy voice flew from nerves. Maybe the living room affected him. A men's club would have seemed more authentic, more properly convened, elsewhere. What did I have in mind? A cold ditch? I supposed Kramer's wife, exiled for the evening, had cultivatedthe plants and picked the orange rug and the luscious fabrics on the couches and chairs. Ideas of happiness. Berliner and I remained standing, as if the fabrics--heavy velvets, beige tones--were nothing to violate with our behinds. It was a woman's living room, but so what? The point of the club was to be with men, not to worry about women. I turned to Berliner and asked what he did for a living."Real estate," he said, grinning ferociously, as if. extreme types were into that. Wild fellows. "I drove in from San Jose." He spoke with rapid little shrugs, as if readjusting his vertebrae. His eyes, after two drags on the cigarette, were full of green distance. He was already driving back to San Jose, I figured. Then he said, "Forgive me for saying this, but a minute ago, when Kramer introduced us, I had a weird thought.""You did?"His eyes returned to me with a look I'd seen before. It signaled the California plunge into truth."I hope this doesn't bother you. I thought ..."I waited."Oh, forget it, man.""No, please go on. What did you think?""I thought you had a withered leg.""You did?""Yeah, but I see you don't. Isn't that weird?""Weird that I don't have a withered leg?""Yeah, I thought your leg was all screwed up. Like withered."I wiggled my legs. For my sake, not his. He stared as if into unusual depths and seemed, regardless of my wiggling, not convinced. Then he said, "I'm forty-seven.""You look much younger." This was true. But, with the white hair, he also looked older."I stay in shape," he answered, marijuana smoke leaking from his nostrils. "Nobody," he said, sucking the leak back against crackling sheets of snot, "nobody else in the room is forty-seven. I'm oldest. I asked the guys."He gagged, then released smoke, knifing it through compressed lips. "Kramer is thirty-eight."I wondered if conversation had ever been more like medical experience, so rich in gas and mucus. "I'm always the oldest. Ever since I was a kid I was the oldest." He giggled and intensified his stare, waiting for me to confess something, too. I giggled back at him in a social way. Then the door opened and Cavanaugh walked in."Excuse me," I said, intimating regret but moving quickly away.My friend Cavanaugh--big, handsome guy--hadheroic charisma. He'd been a professional basketball player. Now he worked at the university in special undergraduate programs, matters of policy and funding. Nine to five, jacket and tie. To remember his former work--the great naked shoulders and legs flying through the air--was saddening. In restaurants and airports people still asked for his autograph.Things felt better, more natural, healthier, with the big man in the room. Kramer reached him before I did. They slapped each other's arms, laughing, pleased at how they felt to each other. Solid. Real. I watched, thinking I'd often watched Cavanaugh. Ever since college, in fact, when he'd become famous. To see him burn his opponent and score was like a miracle of justice. In civilian clothes, he was faintly disorienting. Especially his wristwatch, a golden, complicated band. Symbolic manacle. Cavanaugh's submission to ordinary life. He didn't burn anybody. He'd once said, "I don't want my kids to grow up like me, necks thicker than their heads." He wanted his kids in jackets and wristwatches.He stopped slapping Kramer's arms, but Kramer continued touching him and looked as though he might soon pee in his pants. People love athletes. Where else these days do they see such mythic drama? Images of unimpeachable excellence. I was infected byKramer's enthusiasm, a bit giddy now at the sight of Cavanaugh. When Kramer left to get him a beer, we shook hands. He said, "I didn't think I'd see you tonight." There was mockery in his smile."It's not so easy getting out of the house. Nobody but you could have dragged me to this.""You open the door, you're out.""Tell me about it.""I'm glad you're here. Anything happen yet? I'm a little late because Sarah thinks the club idea is wrong. I'm wrong to be here. We argued at dinner." He whispered, "Maybe it isn't easy," and looked at his wristwatch, frowning, as if it were his mind. Kramer returned with the beer just as a phone started ringing.</p><h2>Michelin Regional Maps: France: Paris and Surrounding Areas Map 514 (Michelin Regional, 514)</h2><p>Michelin hard-cover regional maps for France contain practical road and route information.

But most of white America knew nothing about this story because mainstream newspapers said little about the color line and less about the efforts to end it. Even today, as far as most Americans know, the integration of baseball revolved around Branch Rickey&#x2019;s signing of Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x2019; organization in 1945. This book shows how Rickey&#x2019;s move, critical as it may well have been, came after more than a decade of work by black and left-leaning journalists to desegregate the game.<br>Drawing on hundreds of newspaper articles and interviews with journalists, Chris Lamb reveals how differently black and white newspapers, and black and white America, viewed racial equality. He shows how white mainstream sportswriters perpetuated the color line by participating in what their black counterparts called a &#x201c;conspiracy of silence.&#x201d; Between 1933 and 1945, black newspapers and the Communist<i> Daily Worker</i> published hundreds of articles and editorials calling for an end to baseball&#x2019;s color line.

Known as the Russian Leonardo da Vinci, he became a Russian Orthodox priest in 1911, while remaining deeply involved with the cultural, artistic, and scientific developments of his time. Arrested briefly by the Soviets in 1928, he returned to his scholarly activities until 1933, when he was sentenced to ten years of corrective labor in Siberia. There he continued his scientific work and ministered to his fellow prisoners until his death four years later. This volume is the first English translation of his rich and fascinating defense of Russian Orthodox theology.</p><br><p> Originally published in 1914, the book is a series of twelve letters to a "brother" or "friend," who may be understood symbolically as Christ. Central to Florensky's work is an exploration of the various meanings of Christian love, which is viewed as a combination of <i>philia</i> (friendship) and <i>agape</i> (universal love). Florensky is perhaps the first modern writer to explore the so-called "same-sex unions," which, for him, are not sexual in nature. He describes the ancient Christian rites of the <i>adelphopoiesis</i> (brother-making), joining male friends in chaste bonds of love. In addition, Florensky is one of the first thinkers in the twentieth century to develop the idea of the Divine Sophia, who has become one of the central concerns of feminist theologians.</p></p><p><p>"One of the most important and controversial works of Russian religious philosophy."--<b>Richard Pevear, translator of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i></b></p><b>Boris Jakim</b> is an experienced translator of Russian religious thought.

From that era date the barn of one Abel Bristol, photographed in this book, and the diary of his contemporary and neighbor, Philo Blinn, also printed here. The two men lived out their days amid the unremarkable circumstances of ordinary farm labor, and precisely in that lies their interest for us today - for they exemplify a way of life in America that has now all but vanished, yet should remain a living part of our heritage.<br>The finely grained photographs of the barn, which still stands in East Chatham, New York, were taken recently by John Szarkowski, Director Emeritus of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In his images of the barn, he shows this object of craft to have a simple dignity of its own and at the same time a satisfying, complex structure. It is a vestige of a time when such elaborate works of hand labor were so commonplace as to be taken for granted.<br>Interwoven with the photographs are selections from the neighbor's diary, written as Philo Blinn and his family pursued their daily lives in an age marked by the Civil War. The vivid scenes he recorded are episodic and diverse: the daily round of farm work; the birth (and death) of a child who came unexpectedly to her parents late in their lives; moments of meditation and tranquility amid worry over crops and livestock; and, again and again; the diarist's ongoing, silent debate with the local minister's weekly sermons. Through the decades that Blinn chronicled run continuing threads of human interest that make for a lively and often moving reading experience.<br>The diary and photographs together give a clear-eyed sense of rural life a century ago - its joys, its sorrows, and its mundane realities. They suggest what it meant, in a younger America, to labor on the earth.</p><p>John Szarkowski was Director of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, for three decades and is now Director Emeritus.</p><h2>Stalin Against the Jews</h2><p>The first full-scale account of Joseph Stalin's personal vendetta against Soviet Jews.<br>Drawing on newly opened archives and on his own experiences in the USSR of the early 1950s, the investigative journalist-lawyer Arkady Vaksberg reveals the genesis and evolution of the Communist leader's malevolent campaign - and the extraordinary cunning and shrewdness of his tactics. He shows us Stalin prosecuting prominent Jews in the notorious trials of the 1930s while appointing Jews as commanders of eleven out of twelve Gulags. We see the "Man of Steel" awarding the Order of Lenin to a celebrated Jew every time he launches a new anti-Semitic assault - and choosing a Jew, the infinitely hypocritical and sadistic Lazar Kaganovich, as his protege and chief hatchet-man. All this, while thousands of innocent Jewish men and women across the Soviet Union are being stripped of their jobs and property . . . arbitrarily arrested . . . summarily shot.<br>Vaksberg also tells of the trumped-up trial of Soviet Jewish diplomats that was ultimately abandoned after Hitler's invasion; the curious life, and death, of the Jewish Antifascist Committee; the state-ordered murder of the great actor-director Solomon Mikhoels; the plan to deport the entire Soviet Jewish population to Siberia; how Ilya Ehrenburg finally abandoned his role as a "house Jew" and dared to criticize Stalin's policies; and the infamous "Doctor's Plot" just before the dictator's death.<br>A fascinating, richly documented, and profoundly shocking work of twentieth-century history.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianGiven the importance of its subject, relatively unexplored, and the talents of its author (The Prosecutor, 1991), this must be judged a major disappointment. Long before he rose to power in the Soviet Union, Stalin had written a much-quoted essay on ``the national question'' in which he argued that the Jews were not a true nation; thus, according to Stalin, they had no right to self-determination. However, as Vaksberg makes abundantly clear, the Soviet leader would happily exploit those who did feel that the Jews were a nation--and felt threatened by it--when it suited his purposes. Vaksberg traces the rise and fall of numerous Jews within Stalin's inner circle, showing how their presence allowed him to whitewash the anti-Semitism of his policies. Ironically, the Hitler-Stalin pact delayed the start of open hostilities against the Jews in the Soviet Union by taking the ``Jewish question'' off the national agenda temporarily. During the war, Stalin needed the prominent members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC), whose appeals to Jews in America produced aid for the Soviet war effort; but it was precisely those Jews in the JAC who would be targeted as ``Zionist conspirators'' after the war. In fact, Vaksberg asserts, the infamous ``Doctors Plot'' of 1952 was supposed to inaugurate a wholesale deportation and murder of Soviet Jews. Fortunately, Stalin's death on the eve of the trials ended that threat. It did not, Vaksberg notes in the book's final chapter, end the political manipulation of anti-Semitism by Stalin's successors. Vaksberg writes with a corrosive sarcasm that becomes wearing with repetition, and the book lacks the sort of documentation and scholarly apparatus that would make it more valuable to historians. He refers often, for instance, to Stalin's secret thoughts while also noting that the dictator rarely committed anything to paper. One hopes that a more comprehensive and comprehensible retelling of this story will become available soon. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Once the heartland of the fierce Manchu empire, this northeastern Chinese region's rich natural resources made it a prize for nations in the process of entering the modern age, and three ambitious nations in the midst of such a transformation lay close enough to Manchuria to attempt to claim it: Japan, Russia, and China. For countries attempting to shake off their feudal past and enter a dynamic era of industrialization, Manchuria's resources presented an irresistible lure. With immense natural resources coupled to economic activity more concentrated than elsewhere in China, this region, abutting Mongolia, Korea, the Yellow Sea, and the Great Wall &#x201c;accounted for 90 percent of China&#x2019;s oil, 70 percent of its iron, 55 percent of its gold, and 33 percent of its trade. If Shanghai remained China&#x2019;s commercial center, by 1931 Manchuria had become its industrial center.&#x201d; (Paine, 2012, 15). Thus, it&#x2019;s not altogether surprising that Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931 resulted from a long, complex chain of historical events stretching back to the late 19th century. Approximately 380,000 square miles in extent, or 1.4 times the size of the American state of Texas, Manchuria came into Imperial Russia's possession in 1900 due to the &#x201c;Boxer Rebellion&#x201d; in China, but the Russians held it only briefly; their defeat in the Russo-Japanese War shook loose their control from important parts of Manchuria by the end of 1905. The Japanese gained two important footholds in Manchuria thanks to their victory. One consisted of Port Arthur (renamed Ryojun by the Japanese), an economically and strategically vital harbor city on the Liaodung Peninsula, plus the peninsula itself. The other comprised the South Manchurian Railway, which the Russians gave to the Japanese as a prize of war, in lieu of a cash indemnity. The Japanese subsequently formed the South Manchurian Railway Company, mostly owned by the Japanese Army, and Japanese civilians began investing heavily in Manchuria's lucrative industries. Tens of thousands of entrepreneurs flooded into Manchuria, greatly strengthening Japan's interests in the area. The Japanese Army stepped up their presence in this economically vital region, creating a quasi-independent military force and government known as the &#x201c;Kwantung Army.&#x201d; Naturally, the Chinese also wanted their portion of the tempting Manchurian feast. Unable to go head to head with the organized, thoroughly militaristic Japanese, they sent some 6 million emigrant laborers and settlers into the area as a sort of &#x201c;demographic occupation.&#x201d; Nominally Chinese but subject to massive Japanese investment and military infiltration, filled with bandits and rival chieftains, Manchuria hovered on the brink of another conflict in the 1920s. The Kwantung Army deliberately shoved it over that brink in 1931, and the Japanese invasion and occupation of Manchuria is sometimes described as the true beginning of World War II. At the very least, it marked the expansion of Japan&#x2019;s imperial empire, its ongoing friction with China, and what would turn into a Chinese resistance campaign that would last nearly 15 years until the end of World War II. Given its importance, the invasion of Manchuria continues to be remembered as one of the seminal events of the 20th century.

A meditation on longing in all of life's stages, a literary mystery, and a novel with much for book clubs to untangle.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Concord Monitor</i></p><p>&#x201c;Greene's genre-bending novel of madness and despair evokes both the predatory lasciviousness of Nabokov's classic, <i>Lolita</i>, and the anxious ambiguity of Gillian Flynn's contemporary thriller, <i>Gone Girl </i>(2012).&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nothing is what it appears in this brilliant story of a life gone awry... The author's true intentions make this tale even more remarkable, for the book is, at its core, a trenchant examination of one family's terrible loss and how the aftermath of tragedy can make or break a person's soul.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Greene has created a brilliant, harrowing novel depicting the spectacular unraveling of a once distinguished and proudly successful man. He has also conceived one of the most convincingly drawn unreliable narrators that readers may ever meet, a character recalling the creations of Edgar Allan Poe...

It has all the hooks &#x2013; a mystery, a marriage, an investigation, a loss, a close-up of a society I'm not privy to &#x2013; and yet, at its heart, there are unexpected love stories embedded within.

The truth is somewhere but who has it? Mystery and suspense can be abused in the wrong hands but Greene plays with the psychology behind the story so deftly there is no feeling of suspending belief or being toyed with, instead, there is love, tenderness, and the sad truth of what the mind does to ensure survival. <i>The Headmaster's Wife</i> is a painfully beautiful look at where our decisions and expectations take us.

The involvement of opposition parties gave rise in 2003 to two rebel movements, leading to a brutal insurgency and a horrific counterinsurgency?but not to genocide, as the West has declared.<br><br>Mamdani also explains how the Cold War exacerbated the twenty-year civil war in neighboring Chad, creating a confrontation between Libya?s Muammar al-Qaddafi (with Soviet support) and the Reagan administration (allied with France and Israel) that spilled over into Darfur and militarized the fighting. By 2003, the war involved national, regional, and global forces, including the powerful Western lobby, who now saw it as part of the War on Terror and called for a military invasion dressed up as ?humanitarian intervention.?<br><br>Incisive and authoritative, <i>Saviors and Survivors </i>will radically alter our understanding of the crisis in Darfur.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Mahmood Mamdani</b> is Herbert Lehman Professor of Government and a member of the departments of anthropology; political science; and Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.

But what is the lesson of Rwanda? For many of those mobilized to save Darfur, the lesson is to rescue before it is too late, to act before seeking to understand. Though it is never explicitly stated, Rwanda is recalled as a time when we thought we needed to know more; we waited to find out, to learn the difference between Tutsi and Hutu, and why one was killing the other, but it was too late. Needing to know turned into an excuse for doing nothing. What is new about Darfur, human rights interventionists will tell you, is the realization that sometimes we must respond ethically and not wait. That time is when genocide is occurring.<br><br>But how do we know it is genocide? Because we are told it is. This is why the battle for naming turns out to be all- important: Once Darfur is named as the site of genocide, people recognize something they have already seen elsewhere and conclude that what they know is enough to call for action. They need to know no more in order to act. But killing is not what defines genocide. Killing happens in war, in insurgency and counterinsurgency. It is killing with intent to eliminate an entire group&#x2014;a race, for example&#x2014;that is genocide.<br><br>Those who prioritize knowing over doing assume that genocide is the name of a consequence, and not its context or cause. But how do we decipher &#x201c;intent&#x201d; except by focusing on both context and consequence? The connection between the two is the only clue to naming an action. We shall see that the violence in Darfur was driven by two issues: one local, the other national. The local grievance focused on land and had a double background; its deep background was a colonial legacy of parceling Darfur between tribes, with some given homelands and others not; its immediate background was a four-decades-long process of drought and desertification that exacerbated the conflict between tribes with land and thosewithout.The national contextwas a rebellion that brought the state into an ongoing civil (tribal) war.<br><br>The conflict in Darfur began as a localized civil war (1987&#x2013;89) and turned into a rebellion (beginning in 2003). That Darfur was the site of genocide was the view of one side in the civil war&#x2014;the tribes with land whosought to keep out landless or land-poor tribes fleeing the advancing drought and desert. As early as the 1989 reconciliation conference in Darfur, that side was already using the language of &#x201c;genocide&#x201d;&#x2014;and indeed &#x201c;holocaust.&#x201d; But that charge was made against the coalition of tribes they fought, and not against the government of Sudan. In spite of this important difference, that language has come to inform the view of those who blew the whistle&#x2014;genocide&#x2014;at theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2004 and was translated into a unanimous resolution of both houses of theU.S.Congress that year.<br><br>Observers noted the exceptional brutality with which both sides fought the civil war. This derived in part from the zero-sum nature of the conflict: the land conflict was about group survival. If the stakes were already high, the lethal means to wage this bitter conflict were provided by external powers. In the opening phase, these deadly weapons came from adversaries in the Cold War over Chad: Colonel Muammar al-Quaddafi of Libya and the anti-Libyan triad (Reaganite America, France, and Israel); with the onset of rebellion, the government of Sudan stepped in to wage a brutal counterinsurgency, just as the managers of the War on Terror set about framing the government as genocidaire while shielding the insurgents in the name of justice.<br><br>There have been two international reports on the post-2003 violence in Darfur. The first was by the U.N. Commission on Darfur (2005) and the second from the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (2008). Neither paid attention to the land question that has fueled the two-decades-long civil war in Darfur. Instead, they focused on those who had contributed to further militarizing the conflict. But even that focus was partial, limited to the government of Sudan; it was silent about the role of regional and international powers in exacerbating and militarizing the conflict over the Cold War and the subsequent War on Terror.<br><br>The U.N. Commission concluded &#x201c;that the Government of Sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide,&#x201d; for the element of &#x201c;genocidal intent&#x201d; was missing. It derived the government&#x2019;s lack of genocidal intent from the context of the violence: &#x201c;it would seem that those who planned and organized attacks on villages pursued the intent to drive the victims from their homes, primarily for purposes of counter-insurgency warfare.&#x201d;1 In contrast, when the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court charged the president of Sudan, Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, with genocide, he focused on the consequences of the violence, not its context.<br><br>Let us compare deaths related to violence in two places: Darfur and Iraq. The Darfur insurgency began in 2003, the same year as the United States invaded Iraq. I discuss estimates of the number of &#x201c;excess deaths&#x201d; (that is, deaths beyond what would ordinarily be expected) in Darfur in chapter 1, but, briefly, the estimates for the period during which the violence was horrendous (2003&#x2013;4) range from 70,000 to 400,000. Compare this with three available estimates of excess deaths in Iraq following the U.S. invasion in 2003.* The lowest comprehensive estimate, from the Iraqi Health Ministry survey, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, is of 400,000 Iraqi deaths, of which 151,000 are said to be &#x201c;violent deaths.&#x201d; A middling estimate is from the British medical journal The Lancet: an estimated 654,965 excess deaths, of which 601,027 are said to be violent. The highest estimate comes from a survey by Opinion Research Business, an independent polling agency located in London: 1,033,000 violent deaths as a result of the conflict. The first two estimates cover the period from the 2003 invasion to June 2006. The third survey extends to August 2007.2<br><br>Not only are the figures for Iraq far higher than those for Darfur, ranging from a low of 400,000 to a high of 1,033,000, but the proportion of violent deaths in relation to the total excess mortality is also far higher in Iraq than in Darfur: 38 percent to nearly 92 percent in Iraq, but 20 to 30 percent in Darfur. So why do we call the killing in Darfur genocide but not that in Iraq? Is it because, despite the wide disparity in the number of excess deaths, whether violence- related or violent, victims and perpetrators belong to different races in Darfur but not in Iraq? That is what many assume, but the facts do not bear this out.<br><br>Those who blew the whistle on Darfur in 2004 have continued to argue, for almost four years, that the violence in Darfur is racially motivated, perpetrated by &#x201c;light- skinned Arabs&#x201d; on &#x201c;black Africans.&#x201d; In the chapters that follow, I suggest that this kind of framing of the violence continues the error that came out of the colonial tradition of racializing the peoples of Sudan.<br><br>This book invites the reader to rethink Rwanda in light of Darfur. Rather than a call to act in the face of moral certainty, it is an argument against those who substitute moral certainty for knowledge, and who feel virtuous even when acting on the basis of total ignorance.<br><br>Indeed, the lesson of Darfur is a warning to those who would act first and understand later. Only those possessed of disproportionate power can afford to assume that knowing is irrelevant, thereby caring little about the consequences of their actions. Not only is this mind-set the driving force behind the War on Terror, it also provides the selfindulgent motto of the human rights interventionist recruited into the ranks of the terror warriors. This feel-good imperative can be summed up as follows: as long as I feel good, nothing else matters. It is this shared mind-set that has turned the movement to Save Darfur into the humanitarian face of the War on Terror.<br><br>In contrast to those who suggest that we act the minute the whistle blows, I suggest that, even before the whistle blows, we ceaselessly try to know the world in which we live&#x2014;and act. Even if we must act on imperfect knowledge, we must never act as if knowing is no longer relevant.<br><br>Save Darfur activists combine a contemptuous attitude toward knowing with an imperative to act. Trying hard not to be &#x201c;good Germans,&#x201d; they employ techniques of protest politics against their own government&#x2014;and now the government of China&#x2014;and turn a deaf ear to experts who they claim only complicate the story with so many details as to miss the main point. Instead, they rely on the evidence of their eyes and avoid any discussion of context. But by letting pictures and interviews do the talking, they have opened an entire movement to &#x201c;the CNN effect.&#x201d; If &#x201c;good Germans&#x201d; were taught to trust their leaders first and ask questions later, the good souls mobilized to save Darfur are taught to trust pictures above all else and ask questions later. Above all, they strip Darfur&#x2014;and the violence in Darfur&#x2014;of context.<br>I put Darfur as well as Rwanda in a national, African, and global context, which over the past century has been one of colonialism, the Cold War, and the War on Terror. In 2001, I wrote a book on the Rwanda genocide in which I warned against conferring an ethic of impunity on those who resist genocide. Such impunity led to the killing of some of the millions who died in Congo between 1998 and 2002. Equally, I warned against turning Nuremburg into a paradigm for victors&#x2019; justice and employing it as a response to the Rwanda genocide. For a continent where a relentless pursuit of justice in the postindependence period had all too often turned into vengeance, a more relevant paradigm would be that of survivors&#x2019; justice. Based on South Africa&#x2019;s transition to a postapartheid society, it would seek to reconcile rather than to punish, to look forward rather than backward.<br><br>Calling the violence in Darfur genocide has had three consequences. First, it has postponed any discussion of context while imposing the view of one party in the 1987&#x2013;89 civil war in the name of stopping the &#x201c;genocide.&#x201d; Second, it has conferred impunity on these same partisans by casting them as resisters to genocide. Finally, the description of the violence as genocide&#x2014;racial killing&#x2014;has served to further racialize the conflict and give legitimacy to those who seek to punish rather than to reconcile. Thus, the movement to save Darfur, which initially had the salutary effect of directing world attention to the horrendous violence in Darfur in 2003&#x2013;4,must now bear some of the blame for delaying reconciliation by focusing on a single- minded pursuit of revenge as punishment.<br><br>There is an important difference between Rwanda and Darfur. Rwanda was the site of genocide. Darfur is not. It is, rather, the site where the language of genocide has been turned into an instrument. It is where genocide has become ideological.</p><h2>Wicca: A Comprehensive Guide to the Old Religion in the Modern World</h2><p>With more than 75,000 copies sold, this book has become the classic, introductory to one of the oldest&#x2014;and fastest growing&#x2014;religions in the world.

The "bright, light, colorful, and uplifting Renaissance spectacle" emerging from the ongoing restoration has helped replace the myth of a "grim, black, troubled" Michelangelo as agonized godlike sufferer, with the impression of a down-to-earth artist, clear-eyed and rational. This delightfully irreverent, psychologically astute on-the-scene report gives us a Michelangelo who took shortcuts, repeated himself and eradicated his mistakes, a snob who tried to cover up his origins, tolerated no competitors and was obsessed with money. Arts editor for a British TV network, Januszczak throws a sharp light on art world politics, Renaissance studies and the Japanese yen for Western culture. The book, however, would have benefited from illustrations. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Despite the author's credentials as former art and literary critic for The Guardian , readers will find no serious exposition of fact here. Flip commentary posing as criticism alternates with fiction, movie dialog, episodes of torture, and emphasis on sexual practices and prowess. There is real controversy over the 1980s conservation and cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, sponsored by a Japanese TV network, but Januszcak does little more than muddy the issues while supporting the results.

Two months before the outbreak of the Second World War, eighteen-year-old Geoffrey Wellum becomes a fighter pilot with the RAF... Desperate to get in the air, he makes it through basic training to become the youngest Spitfire pilot in the prestigious 92 Squadron. Thrust into combat almost immediately, Wellum finds himself flying several sorties a day, caught up in terrifying dogfights with German Me 109s. Over the coming months he and his fellow pilots play a crucial role in the Battle of Britain. But of the friends that take to the air alongside Wellum many never return. The Centenary Collection: 1.

Aviva Chomsky and Aldo A. Lauria Santiago have gathered both well-known and emerging scholars to demonstrate how the actions and ideas of rural workers, peasants, migrants, and women formed an integral part of the growth of the export economies of the era and to examine the underacknowledged impact such groups had on the shaping of national histories. <br>Responding to the fact that the more common, elite-centered &#x201c;national&#x201d; histories distort or erase the importance of gender, race, ethnicity, popular consciousness, and identity, contributors to this volume correct this imbalance by moving these previously overlooked issues to the center of historical research and analysis. In so doing, they describe how these marginalized working peoples of the Hispanic Caribbean Basin managed to remain centered on not only class-based issues but on a sense of community, a desire for dignity, and a struggle for access to resources. Individual essays include discussions of plantation justice in Guatemala, highland Indians in Nicaragua, the effects of foreign corporations in Costa Rica, coffee production in El Salvador, banana workers in Honduras, sexuality and working-class feminism in Puerto Rico, the Cuban sugar industry, agrarian reform in the Dominican Republic, and finally, potential directions for future research and historiography on Central America and the Caribbean. <br>This collection will have a wide audience among Caribbeanists and Central Americanists, as well as students of gender studies, and labor, social, Latin American, and agrarian history. <p></p><p><i>Contributors</i>.

The two first met in 1906 when Matisse had achieved recognition for his innovative Fauvist works and Picasso was poised to challenge for the leadership of the avant-garde. Though the pair were never intimate friends they maintained contact for the last twenty years of Matisse&#39;s life and their artistic relationship can be addressed through an analysis of a key group of their works. This volume discusses themes of the primitive, prompting differing responses in their art, and their common dependence on the Western figurative tradition. It goes on to explore their parallel development as leading sculptors and their unceasing invention in the field of collage. It further views the impact of their differing working methods, Matisse&#39;s reaction to Cubism and Picasso&#39;s preoccupation with brilliant colour and decorative pattern.</p><p></p><h2>Jimmy&#39;s Boa Bounces Back</h2><p>A pet boa constrictor wreaks havoc on a posh garden party.</p><p>&#39;Imagination and hilarity about in this unique story of a women&#39;s garden party attended by a boa constrictor.

He distinguishes between culture as a concept, culture as a structure and culture as praxis and analyzes the different ways in which culture has been used in each of these settings. For Bauman, culture is a living, changing aspect of human interaction which must be understood and studied as a universal of human life. At the heart of his approach is the proposition that culture is inherently ambivalent.<p></p> <p>With a major new introduction to this new edition, this classic work emerges as a crucial link in the development of Bauman&#x2032;s thought.

It is a story told, and retold, by dueling author-illustrators. M?lanie Watt starts out with the story of a mouse in a house. Then M?lanie&#39;s cat, Chester, sends the mouse packing and proceeds to cover the pages with rewrites from his red marker, and the gloves are off. M?lanie and her mouse won&#39;t take Chester&#39;s antics lying down. And Chester is obviously a creative powerhouse with confidence to spare. Where will this war of the picture-book makers lead?

Barbeau, in keeping with the popular thinking of the time, believed First Nations cultures were about to disappear completely, and that it was up to him to preserve what was left of these dying cultures while he could. Unfortunately, his methods of preserving First Nations cultures included purchasing totem poles and potlatch items from struggling communities in order to sell them to museums. While Barbeau strove to protect First Nations cultures from vanishing, he ended up playing an active role in dismantling the very same cultures he tried to save.<br><br>Drawing inspiration from Barbeau&#x2019;s canonical book <i>Totem Poles</i>, Jordan Abel explores the complicated relationship between First Nations cultures and ethnography. His poems simultaneously illuminate Barbeau&#x2019;s intentions and navigate the repercussions of the anthropologist&#x2019;s actions.<br><br>Through the use of erasure techniques, Abel carves out new understandings of Barbeau&#x2019;s writing each layer reveals a fresh perspective, each word takes on a different connotation, each letter plays a different role, and each punctuation mark rises to the surface in an unexpected way. As Abel writes his way ever deeper into Barbeau&#x2019;s words, he begins to understand that he is much more connected to Barbeau than he originally suspected.</p><p><b>Jordan Abel</b> is a First Nations writer who lives in Vancouver. He holds a B.A. from the University of Alberta and a M.F.A. from the University of British Columbia. Jordan is an editor for <i>Poetry Is Dead</i> magazine and the former poetry editor for <i>PRISM International</i>. His work has been published in many journals and magazines across Canada, including <i>CV2</i>, <i>The Capilano Review</i>, <i>Prairie Fire</i>, <i>dANDelion</i>, <i>Geist</i>, <i>ARC Poetry Magazine</i>, <i>Descant</i>, <i>Broken Pencil</i>, <i>OCW Magazine</i>, <i>filling Station</i>, <i>Grain</i>, and <i>Canadian Literature</i>. In early 2013, Above/Ground Press published his chapbook <i>Scientia</i>."Abel subverts the museological gaze that steals, deadens, and imprisons totem poles, thereby disappearing the Indigenous peoples who consider totem poles an integral part of their knowledge systems and cultures." (Lindsay Nixon <i>All Lit Up</i>)<br><br><br>"<em>The Place of Scraps</em> by Jordan Abel is a brave, creative, perceptive text that operates by breaking, exposing, and inverting the assumptions of poetry and place, piece-by-piece. This is art of the concept, used to unmake language so that language may live." &#x2013; Wayde Compton<br><br>"Jordan Abel's [<em>The</em>] <em>Place of Scraps</em> is an anthropology of anthropology, done as only a[n Aboriginal / Indigenous] poet could do." <br>&#x2013; Ray Hsu, author of <em>Cold Sleep Permanent Afternoon</em><br><br>"<em>The Place of Scraps</em> demonstrates the infinite expressiveness of experimental writing, in particular concrete poetry; Abel&#x2019;s textual erasures and collisions manage, all at once, to viscerally enact losses, give voice to silenced histories, make plain the bonds between curation and colonization, reveal cascading ironies, and amplify the commentary of mosquitos. Abel is a master carver of the page."<br>&#x2013; Susan Holbrook, author of Trillium nominated <em>Joy Is So Exhausting</em><br><br>"With his breakout collection of visual poetry, Jordan Abel conjures the near impossible: a heartbreaking history lesson, both person and public, mixed with lyricism, intelligence, humour and cold-eyed facts. This narrative of the misguided, good-hearted Marius Barbeau and what he did with First Nations cultural icons will be a revelation for many. What Abel takes from language is what gives it form and strength: a more apt use of plunder verse I cannot imagine." &#x2013; Carolyn Smart<br><br>"These astonishingly inventive poems reframe encounters with ethnology and memory by evoking both the anxiety of erasure and the prismatic potential of palimpsestic reading. Just as the huge totem pole travelling through the heart of the book is cut apart and pieced back together, <em>The Place of Scraps</em> reconfigures the contingencies involved with making sense of ancestry, preservation, and interpretation itself. Abel&#x2019;s writing constantly dazzles and rewards with its linguistic playfulness and conceptual sophistication." &#x2013; Adam Dickinson<br><br>"By taking Marius Barbeau's texts as both its theme and source, <em>The Place of Scraps</em> takes on the legacy of the potlatch, an event irresolvably suspended between dynamics of excess and loss, investment and destruction, gift and exchange, general and restricted economies. As Christopher Bracken has argued, the potlatch was, in some sense, paradoxically invented by the very Canadian laws that sought to destroy it, even as the goods exchanged in such ceremonies were often supplied by European-Canadians traders, even as indigenous arts flourished under the fur trade, and just as Barbeau's attempts to preserve cultures aided directly in their dissolution. In <em>The Place of Scraps</em>, all these debts of history are put back into play, with interest (in every sense of the term), as the excessive significations of language's material properties are recuperated, celebrated, and sacrificed in turn. With sustained attention, serious criticism, and generous respect, Jordan Abel has latched onto the extraordinary luck of lack." &#x2013; Dr. Craig Dworkin<br><br>"English litters the sky, its typed letters eventually demolished into illegible insects that flit above archival photo-testimony to land/people. As Abel delves into the historical record with poetic precision, language is revealed to be uncanny rubble. Everything tilts with the pole, rendered into relationship. A surprising and necessary book of poetry, <em>The Place of Scraps</em> is as humbly unstoppable as the next breath you take in and release back out to the world." &#x2013; Rita Wong<br></p><h2>Abbott&#39;s American Watchmaker: An Encyclopedia for the Horologist, Jeweler, Gold and Silversmith</h2><p>Back in all its original prestige <i>Abbott&#x2019;s American Watchmaker and Jeweler</i> remains the ultimate resource for watchmaking and jewelry craftsmanship.

Colonel Podhajsky examines in depth the psychology of riding and the relationship between teacher, pupil and horse. He includes chapters on the basic theory of riding; dressage; systematic riding instruction; overcoming difficulties and setbacks and participating in competitions. Now considered a classic of equestrian literature, The Riding Teacher should be read by everyone seriously interested in classical riding principles. In her foreword Sylvia Loch says &#34;If every riding instructor, examiner and competitor were to purchase and inwardly digest this the last of Podhajsky&#39;s books, we would all appreciate many happier horses and a higher standard of equitation throughout the land.&#34; Colonel Podhajsky was considered to be a great riding teacher and a fine competitor whose skill and elegance made him one of the most accomplished horsemen of the post-war era.

As an iconic work, the book has often been shielded from critical inquiry, but this landmark anniversary provides an excellent opportunity to reassess its legacy and influence. In Silent Spring at 50: The False Crises of Rachel Carson a team of national experts explores the book&#x2019;s historical context, the science it was built on, and the policy consequences of its core ideas. The conclusion makes it abundantly clear that the legacy of Silent Spring is highly problematic. While the book provided some clear benefits, a number of Carson&#x2019;s major arguments rested on what can only be described as deliberate ignorance. Despite her reputation as a careful writer widely praised for building<br>her arguments on science and facts, Carson&#x2019;s best-seller contained significant errors and sins of omission. Much of what was presented as certainty then was slanted, and today we know much of it is simply wrong.</p><p>Roger E.

I grabbed Emikai&#x2019;s half-paralyzed hand, twisted it hard at the wrist, and swiveled on my left foot to bend the arm over, forcing him to bow forward at the waist. &#x201c;Well, <i>Logra</i> Emikai?&#x201d; I countered.<br>&#x201c;Better,&#x201d; Emikai said approvingly. &#x201c;Much better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, letting go of his hand. &#x201c;I take it I hit the nerve junction properly that time?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; he confirmed as he straightened up, massaging his right upper arm where I&#x2019;d hit it and shaking his right hand where my chin had pressed into another sensitive spot. &#x201c;But you should free your right arm from my left before attempting to turn me over. Otherwise I might pull you over with me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but it might also give you enough time to get your balance back,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;Anyway, if this had been a real fight, I&#x2019;d have followed up with a kick to your torso.&#x201d; I snapped a short kick to the area around his heart, stopping my foot a couple of centimeters short of his body. &#x201c;Right about there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, that would put a normal opponent into the dust,&#x201d; Emikai agreed. &#x201c;But bear in mind that a professional fighter might have had his heart sac strengthened against such attacks.&#x201d;<br>I grimaced. He was right, of course. A Filly pro might boast a strengthened heart sac, some extra bone in his fists, and enhanced brow ridges to protect his eyes, and might even have gone to the effort to have his more vulnerable nerve junctions surgically moved to entirely different locations. With the Filiaelian passion for genetic manipulation, a Filly with sufficient money and patience could remake himself into almost anything he or his doctor could imagine.<br>Which was precisely why we were in this mess to begin with.<br>I turned to Bayta. &#x201c;How did it look?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Painful,&#x201d; she said, her eyes smoldering as she looked at Emikai. In her opinion&#x2014;which she hadn&#x2019;t been at all shy about sharing with me over the past few days&#x2014;our sparring sessions were way more realistic than they needed to be. Certainly more realistic than she liked.<br>&#x201c;Pure illusion,&#x201d; I assured her. Actually, my various bruises and strained muscles were in full agreement with her. But once upon a time I&#x2019;d been a Western Alliance Intelligence agent, and Emikai and I both knew that the only way to learn hand-to-hand combat techniques was by actually practicing them. &#x201c;Do we have time for one more?&#x201d; I asked her.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; she said, a little too quickly.<br>&#x201c;How long do we have?&#x201d; I asked.<br>Her lip twitched. She really <i>did</i> hate these sessions. &#x201c;Forty-five minutes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So plenty of time.&#x201d; I turned back to Emikai. &#x201c;I want you to try the throat lock you put me in back on the super-express train.&#x201d; I turned my back on him. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ve come up with a counter.&#x201d;<br>His right arm snaked around my neck, his left arm linking with it, his left hand pushing my head forward against the forearm already pressed against my throat. His left foot slapped lightly against the back of my left knee, just hard enough to break my balance and send me to my knees on the floor. He followed me down, maintaining his grip, leaning forward and half over my shoulder.<br>That was how it had worked the last time he&#x2019;d pulled this move on me. This time, I had something new to bring to the table. My knees had barely hit the floor when I threw myself forward, pulling Emikai off balance and tumbling over on top of me. As my chest hit the floor I rolled onto my left side, bringing my right elbow up into a shark-fin angle.<br>And as he belatedly let go of my neck in an effort to break his fall, his torso slammed onto my extended elbow.<br>In a real fight I would have kept the elbow extended, letting its impact send a shock wave through his heart sac and hopefully ending the fight right there. In this case, since Emikai wasn&#x2019;t an actual enemy and I furthermore didn&#x2019;t want to lug his twitching carcass all the way back to third class, I let my arm fold back down again, with the result that instead of bouncing off my elbow in agony he merely landed full length on top of me.<br>Fortunately, his extended arms took most of his weight, with the result that we both merely oofed in unison instead of having the air knocked out of us. &#x201c;Impressive,&#x201d; he said, rolling off and standing up again. &#x201c;Aside from the obvious difficulty that if it succeeds you&#x2019;ll be trapped beneath your opponent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; I agreed, getting to my feet and massaging my throat where he&#x2019;d been gripping it. Maybe Bayta was right about Emikai being a bit on the enthusiastic side. &#x201c;Given that the alternative is to be comfortable but dead, it seems worthwhile.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A definite point.&#x201d; He paused, tilting his head thoughtfully to the side. &#x201c;Since we speak of death, what do you intend to tell the director and <i>santras</i> of Proteus Station about <i>Asantra</i> Muzzfor? They will want answers.&#x201d; He eyed me closely. &#x201c;More complete answers, I hope, than those you have given to me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What an odd question,&#x201d; I said, hiding my mild surprise. It had been over four weeks since Muzzfor died his violent death aboard the super-express Quadrail traveling from the other end of the galaxy, and nearly two weeks since Emikai and I had begun these occasional sparring sessions. Not once in all that time had the Filly asked me for details on exactly how Muzzfor had died.<br>Now, with our train forty minutes from journey&#x2019;s end, he was suddenly bringing up the subject? &#x201c;I intend to tell them the truth, of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said as he retrieved his tunic from where he&#x2019;d laid it on my bed. &#x201c;The director and <i>santras</i> would not take well to being lied to. By you, or by anyone else they choose to question.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That <i>anyone else</i> being you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am a former enforcement officer, and was aboard the train where <i>Asantra</i> Muzzfor died,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That makes me a logical person to question.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Only since you didn&#x2019;t actually witness the event, most of what you can tell them will be hearsay,&#x201d; I reminded him.<br>&#x201c;That, plus my trained assessment of the other persons involved.&#x201d;<br>I inclined my head to him. &#x201c;Hence, the exercise sessions?&#x201d;<br>His cream-colored nose blaze didn&#x2019;t lighten or darken, the usual Filly indicators of sudden emotional change. Emikai already knew or suspected that <i>I</i> knew or suspected his reason for suggesting these little playdates. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said without apology or embarrassment.<br>&#x201c;And what do you intend to tell them?&#x201d;<br>For a moment he eyed me in silence. &#x201c;You have purpose about you, Mr. Compton,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I do not yet know what that purpose is. You have honor about you, as well, but I do not yet know to which person or ideals that honor attaches.&#x201d; His eyes took on a sudden intensity. &#x201c;And you have knowledge, but I do not believe you intend to give that knowledge to the director and <i>santras</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;An intriguing analysis,&#x201d; I said, trying to keep my voice casual. Damned if he hadn&#x2019;t hit it squarely on the head. &#x201c;But I <i>do</i> intend to tell them the truth.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I will look forward to hearing it,&#x201d; he said, finishing with his tunic and wrapping his belt and belt bag in place. &#x201c;I go to prepare the others for departure. Until then, farewell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Farewell,&#x201d; I said. He stepped to the door, tapped the release, and disappeared into the corridor.<br>I crossed to the door and locked it behind him. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t really going to tell them the truth, are you?&#x201d; Bayta asked.<br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s finish packing.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Our train pulled into the Ilat Dumar Covrey station exactly on time, which was the way things always worked with the Quadrail system.

By separating government financing of education from government administration of schools, Friedman argued, parents at all income levels would have the freedom to choose the schools their children attend. Liberty &amp; Learning is a collection of essays from the nation's top education experts evaluating the progress of Friedman's innovative idea and reflecting on its merits in the 21st century. The book also contains a special prologue and epilogue by Milton Friedman himself. The contributors to this volume take a variety of approaches to Friedman's voucher idea. All of them assess the merit of Friedman's plan through an energetic, contemporary perspective, though some authors take a theoretical position, while others employ a very pragmatic approach.</p><p>"The contributors offer a thoughtful look at the movement for school choice. Friedman offers an epilogue critical of the power of the teachers' unions and promising to continue to fight for vouchers. Readers interested in education will appreciate the well-considered arguments presented in this thought-provoking book." -Vanessa Bush, Booklist, American Library Association <p>"Liberty &amp; Learning represents a major critical reassessment of the Friedman's vision for school choice. It is by no means just a paean to the genius of the voucher idea. The Friedmans themselves have always relished the spirited debate, and several contributors are ready to give it to them." -School Choice Advocate </p><p>"The movement remains in its infancy, and the `pure' voucher system Milton Friedman proposed has still never been instituted anywhere in the United States. This slim volume, with contributions from 10 educational experts of varying ideological hues, tries to explain why and where to go from here. Suggestions in the book range from downplaying the rhetoric of liberty and adopting the rhetoric of community values to sell vouchers to Myron Lieberman's suggestion that voucher supporters stop compromising and push harder for system wide vouchers for everybody. Abigail Thernstrom suggests a broad voucher program may be the last hope for many African Americans. And James Tooley notes the remarkable 'mushrooming' of inexpensive and superior private schools in poor regions from India to Ghana." -Alan W. Bock, Orange County Register</p>EDITORS Robert C.

This stimulating book describes the winding biographical path of that mission. It focuses in particular on the mystery of Steiner&#x2019;s connection with the influential medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas. Using numerous archival sources and publications, Thomas Meyer reveals many facts related to the core of Steiner's mission, showing the critical roles played by Wilhelm Anton Neumann and Karl Julius Schr�er in its genesis and development. <br><br>Meyer examines how Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s students responded to his understanding of karma, placing this &#x201c;most intrinsic mission&#x201d; in the context of current divisions in the anthroposophic movement. He highlights especially the place of spiritual science in culture and history and shows how Steiner further developed the great scientific ideas of evolution propounded by Darwin by raising them to the plane of individual soul and spiritual development. As Steiner stated in 1903, &#x201c;Scientific researchers explain the skull forms of higher animals as a transformation of a lower type of skull. In the same way one should explain a soul's biography through the soul biography which the former evolved from.&#x201d;</p><p><b>T. H. Meyer</b> was born in Switzerland in 1950.

But long before that men sailed the seas searching for an easier and shorter path to the riches of the orient, and the mapmakers of the day translated sparse information, turning it into often stunningly beautiful maps. The fact that most of the information required to make such a map was missing or erroneous mattered little; the maps live on as testimony to hopes and dreams.<br><br>The idea that the Arctic Ocean was an open sea, unable to freeze due to movement and size, drove early mariners to attempt to sail across the top of the world to reach the spices of the east.

(Studies in Austrian Literature, Culture, and Thought. Translation Series)</h2><p>Ornament and Crime contains thirty-six original essays by the celebrated Viennese architect, Adolf Loos (1870-1933). Most deal with questions of design in a wide range of areas, from architecture and furniture, to clothes and jewelery, pottery, plumbing, and printing; others are polemics on craft education and training, and on design in general. Loos, the great cultural reformer and moralist in the history of European architecture and design was always a &#39;revolutionary against the revolutionaries&#39;. With his assault on Viennese arts and crafts and his conflict with bourgeois morality, he managed to offend the whole country. His 1908 essay &#39;Ornament and Crime&#39;, mocked by an age in love with its accessories, has come to be recognized as a seminal work in combating the aesthetic imperialism of the turn of the century.

Anawalt&#39;s biography not only elegantly describes how the company developed but how it helped shape American dance.A vigorous, finely balanced reporting job on the late Robert Joffrey and his ever-popular dance company. Anawalt, a California dance critic, is an unabashed fan of Joffrey's, yet this volume is no encomium. Instead, her briskly written account of the company from its mythically modest beginnings in 1954 to Joffrey's death from AIDS in 1988 at the age of 59 collects and interprets suggestive facts at nearly every turn. Joffrey's obsession with ballet emerged early: He staged his first ballets when he was a child in Seattle, with costumes borrowed from a neighborhood dry cleaner. When he eventually launched his own company, it was a seat-of-the-pants affair: The fledgling group's no-frills tours of the US were made in a red and white station wagon, driven in breakneck fashion by a roguish stage manager; to save time and money after typical one-night-stand performances, the dancers washed their ballet duds ``by standing in the hotel showers with the tutus and tights still on, throwing laundry detergent over themselves, and then drying the smaller pieces out the next day on the car's interior door handles.'' In addition to her rich store of anecdotes, Anawalt is equally forthcoming in characterizing each stage of the company's struggle to survive and the artistic hallmarks of the evolving Joffrey style (``Learn the classical technique--then forget it,'' Joffrey advised) and mindfully eclectic repertory (Gerald Arpino, Joffrey's frequent collaborator and longtime companion, was successful because he ``made ballets for people who hate ballet,'' she succinctly notes). Unusual among dance critics, she never hides behind a professional dance vocabulary. She also ventures worthwhile observations on contextual issues, such as the uncomfortable coupling of dance with business in this country and the politics of American arts funding. An intelligent, fair, fascinating portrait of a seminal figure in American ballet. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At the same time, the expanding purview of the British empire created a market for images of far-away places. Book publishers quickly seized on these two trends and began producing travel books illustrated with aquatint prints of Indian cave temples, Chinese waterways, African villages, and more. Offering a close analysis of three exceptional publications&#x2014;Thomas and William Daniell&#x2019;s <i>Oriental Scenery </i>(1795&#x2013;1808), William Alexander&#x2019;s <i>Costume of China </i>(1797&#x2013;1805), and Samuel Daniell&#x2019;s <i>African Scenery and Animals </i>(1804&#x2013;5)&#x2014;this volume examines how aquatint became a preferred medium for the visual representation of cultural difference, and how it subtly shaped the direction of Western modernism.</p><p>A captivating history of how aquatint travel books changed the way Britons viewed the world and their place within it in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<b>Douglas Fordham</b> is associate professor of art history at the University of Virginia.</p><h2>Teen Titans/Outsiders: The Insiders</h2><p>The Outsiders think that Indigo, the mysterious and beautiful android, is a traitor, but before they learn who set her up, they receive a cry for help from the Teen Titans as their own traitor is revealed.</p><p></p><h2>Easy Everyday Favorites: From the World&#39;s #1 Cooking Website</h2><p>When there&#39;s barely time for a homemade meal-much less time for mistakes- millions of home cooks turn to allrecipes.com for reliable, quick, and easy recipes that taste great.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Stefan Blau, whom readers will remember from <i>Stones from the River,</i> flees Burgdorf, a small town in Germany, and comes to America in search of the vision he has dreamed of every night. The novel closes nearly a century later with Stefan's granddaughter, Emma, and the legacy of his dream: the Wasserburg, a once-grand apartment house filled with the hidden truths of its inhabitants both past and present. Ursula Hegi creates a fascinating picture of immigrants in America: their dreams and disappointments, the challenges of assimilation, the frailty of language and its transcendence, the love that bonds generations and the cultural wedges that drive them apart.</p><p>Ursula Hegi's <i>The Vision of Emma Blau</i> is an epic story of German immigrants attempting to assimilate while still preserving traces of home in their language and rituals. In 1894 Stefan Blau leaves Europe for America; he is only 13 years old, but he feels the need for another country so strongly that it wakes him up at night. After narrowly escaping a restaurant fire in New York City, he finds himself in New Hampshire. With money he has saved from waiter jobs and poker winnings, he buys a small hotel, which over time he transforms into a six-story, elaborate apartment house. The <i>Wasserburg</i> (water fortress) is a palace towering over a half-empty lake town, standing out in the landscape the same way Stefan's accent stands out in conversation--exotic, awkward, a hybrid of German and American dreams.<p> Hegi's writing is lively and graceful, moving across time, space, and generations without faltering or bogging down. While her scope is vast, her great gift is for particulars: Stefan's third wife, Helene, who has a deep-seated aggression in her soul that her mother attributed to her being a "biter" as a child; his daughter, Greta, who lags in school but notices things no one else does--"the reflection of the half moon that swayed on the water like a slab of frost," or the music of her flute--"long notes that sounded like the calls of large birds flying through the night." These moments of poetry open up <i>The Vision of Emma Blau</i>, halting its swirling world with their loveliness.</p><p> Hegi is best known for her 1994 novel, <i>Stones from the River</i>, which Oprah chose for her book group, catapulting this somewhat obscure writer onto the bestseller lists. But Hegi was around for a long time before Oprah shined the light on her. She is a born storyteller, a witness to the immigrant experience who is reimagining America's past from the perspective of those who desired that country as a promised land, but who even after 100 years could never quite sleep the sleep of its native sons. <i>--Emily White</i></p><b>Ursula Hegi</b> is the author of <i>The Worst Thing I've Done, Sacred Time</i>, <i>Hotel of the Saints</i>, <i>The Vision of Emma Blau</i>, <i>Tearing the Silence</i>, <i>Salt Dancers</i>, <i>Stones from the River</i>, <i>Floating in My Mother's Palm</i>, <i>Unearned Pleasures and Other Stories</i>, <i>Intrusions</i>, and <i>Trudi &amp; Pia</i>.

With great understanding, he shows how Max Planck suffered morally and intellectually as his lifelong habit of service to his country and to physics was confronted by the realities of World War I and the brutalities of the Third Reich.</p><p>In an afterword written for this edition, Heilbron weighs the recurring questions among historians and scientists about the costs to others, and to Planck himself, of the painful choices he faced in attempting to build an &#x201c;ark&#x201d; to carry science and scientists through the storms of Nazism.</p></p><p>J.

Colorful watercolor illustrations enhance the story of a little boy&#39;s attempts to catch a rainbow</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>The Brooklyn Cookbook (Knopf Cooks American)</h2><p>Brooklyn has been called the fourth largest city in America, and it is the Borough's claim that one out of every seven United States citizens has roots here. Brooklyn is also America's most celebrated hometown. Everybody knows where it is (across that bridge), and almost everybody has an opinion about it: don't the people say "boid" and "toity-toid," and act argumentative, brassy, and sassy? Sure they do -- at least some of them. They also say what they mean in other tongues, for groups from all over the world call Brooklyn home.<br><br>Brooklynites are fiercely loyal to neighborhood, family, and the food that nourishes them, body and soul. That is what this book celebrates ... I can hear you asking, What is Brooklyn food? What makes it special? No one claims that we have the kind of food that characterizes a region, such as Boston baked beans, Maryland crab cakes, or Philadelphia cheese steak. What defines our food is, in short, attitude and memory. The Brooklyn attitude is, "You respect me, I'll respect you; but believe me -- my neighborhood, and my food. is best." Memory ensures that the stories of good times, and the food that made them so, are passed along to younger family members.<br><br>The neighborhoods are distinct, but they are ever changing. Where most immigrants once came largely from Europe, they now arrive from the Caribbean and Asia. Formerly Scandinavian Bay Ridge is now home to Greeks, Chinese, and the fastest-growing group of Middle Easterners anywhere. Brooklyn is by no means all blue collar (it never was); Wall Streeters and other executive types appreciate the wonderful houses and tree-lined streets. They have their foodways, too.<br><br>Thomas Wolfe, a writer who once lived in Brooklyn, was wrong: you can go home again, home to the Brooklyn that lives in the rich memories and cherished recipes of the sons and daughters of the Borough. As we who live on the eastern side of the Brooklyn Bridge say, come on over!<br><br>to feeding the Dodgers and the Polar Bear swimmers who brave the icy waters of the Atlantic all winter -- with wonderful nostalgic photographs. Family, tradition, and neighborhood are at the heart of Brooklyn life. And it is the food -- reflected in the kinds of recipes gathered here -- that expresses these values.</p><p>Brooklyn is a melting pot unto itself. Settled by the Dutch and then home to waves of immigrants, including the Irish, Jews, Scandinavians, Italians, Germans, Poles, Hispanics, African Americans, Greeks, and Middle Easterners, the borough is rich in culinary history. Lauding that history, Lyn Stallworth and Rod Kennedy Jr.'s <i>The Brooklyn Cookbook</i> explores in 250 recipes Brooklyn's "hometown" cooking. Replete with nostalgic photos, it also chronicles, in the words of Brooklynites themselves, a larger cultural heritage. Readers who enjoy social-culinary history, and those who relish the diverse, nurturing dishes of everyday urban life, will embrace the book. <p> Dividing its recipes and recollections among chapters such as Resorts and Neighborhoods, Nationalities, and Brewed, Made, Sold, and Served in Brooklyn, the book reminds us constantly that food is inseparable from the people who prepare and eat it. Here are Mrs. Stahl's Potato Cocktail Knishes, which she sold on the Boardwalk during the Depression; Lundy's Manhattan Clam Chowder, the peerless brew of Brooklyn's famed Sheepshead Bay seafood house; Dee Dee Daily's Pigeon Peas and Rice, a Caribbean-Black American specialty; and Joe Romanelli's mamma's Pizza Rustica, prepared while "pappa and my brothers would sit around drinking homebrew and playing pinochle." The recipes work for all cooks, but it is the stories behind them--"An Italian-American Dinner in 1960," for example, or "A Pail of Beer and Sauerbraten"--that make the book a true culinary treasure. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Lyn Stallworth has been a Brooklyn brownstoner for fourteen years; before that she lived in France, Greece, and Manhattan.

The onset of the Great Depression meant there were few opportunities for young men on the prairies, so the pair decided to pursue their dream of trapping in the North.<p></p> <p>This is a vividly recounted tale of life in the northern Saskatchewan wilderness, "the old North, land of mystery and deep silences" only accessible by canoe in summer, by dog team in winter, or by aircraft. The young men embrace the challenges of travelling in the North, and not only survive, but thrive. <em>North to Cree Lake</em> is full of fascinating details about everyday life in the North - what they ate, how they travelled, how to prepare moose nose - and offers insights into the men who chose to live in such an isolated and perilous region. Karras wrote <em>North to Cree Lake</em> many years after he left northern Saskatchewan, but the clarity of his memories is remarkable, as is his deep love of the North.</p> <p>A farmer's assistant for $2 a day, a grain buyer, and ultimately a school administrator, <b>Arthur Karras</b> no longer hunted when he returned to civilization but continued to fish.

But how effective are they, and how well would they be flown in battle? Could Soviet ground crews keep them serviceable in the face of the extraordinary demands of round-the-clock combat, and would pilots and commanders display the creativity and speed of response essential to survival and success in late-20th-century air fighting? What factors have influenced the evolution of the modern Soviet Air Force, and how is it reacting to the new capabilities now being acquired by Western air forces? A senior RAF officer and the editor of Jane&#39;s All the World&#39;s Aircraft have worked together to produce this unique assessment of the organization that is tasked with, among other things, defense of the world&#39;s largest volume of national airspace and the spearheading of any future offensive in Western Europe. Air Vice-Marshal R. A. Mason has drawn widely on Soviet military literature and Western defense sources to assemble a clear picture of the Soviet Air Force&#39;s current doctrine and methods, and to explain how they interact with the design and capabilities of its aircraft. John W. R. Taylor complements his analysis with technical coverage of the 40 or so types currently operated by the Air Force&#39;s air-defense, tactical, maritime, strategic and transport units. The Soviet Air Force of the mid-1980s is grappling with a number of contradictions: aircrews and commanders torn between the need for rigid air discipline and obedience to ground control, and a desire to develop initiative and individual fighting skills; ground crew who have to be coached repeatedly in elementary maintenance tasks, yet feel a loyalty to their units and are confident of their ability to perform well in combat.</p><p></p><h2>Straight Man</h2><p>In this uproarious new novel, Richard Russo performs his characteristic high-wire walk between hilarity and heartbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;Russo's protagonist is William Henry Devereaux, Jr., the reluctant chairman of the English department of a badly underfunded college in the Pennsylvania rust belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist-- and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In the course of a single week, Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague, imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean, wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits, and threaten to execute a goose on local television.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while coming to terms with his philandering father, the dereliction of his youthful promise, and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;in short, <b>Straight Man</b> is classic Russo--side-splitting and true-to-life, witty, compassionate, and impossible to put down.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>First Jane Smiley came out of the comedy closet with <i>Moo</i>, a campus satire par excellence, and now Richard Russo has gotten in on the groves-of-academe game. <i>Straight Man</i> is hilarious sport, with a serious side. William Henry Devereaux Jr., is almost 50 and stuck forever as chair of English at West Central Pennsylvania University. It is April and fear of layoffs--even among the tenured--has reached mock-epic proportions; Hank has yet to receive his department budget and finds himself increasingly offering comments such as "Always understate necrophilia" to his writing students. Then there are his possible prostate problems and the prospect of his father's arrival. Devereaux Sr., "then and now, an academic opportunist," has always been a high-profile professor and a low-profile parent. <p> Though Hank tries to apply William of Occam's rational approach (choose simplicity) to each increasingly absurd situation, and even has a dog named after the philosopher, he does seem to cause most of his own enormous difficulties. Not least when he grabs a goose and threatens to off a duck (sic) a day until he gets his budget. The fact that he is also wearing a fake nose and glasses and doing so in front of a TV camera complicates matters even further. Hank tries to explain to one class that comedy and tragedy don't go together, but finds the argument "runs contrary to their experience. Indeed it may run contrary to my own." It runs decidedly against Richard Russo's approach in <i>Straight Man,</i> and the result is a hilarious and touching novel.</p>"Russo is a master craftsman ...

J. W. Jackson -- retired cop, dedicated fisherman, and passionate cook -- is more or less holed up with his wife, Zee, and their two spunky kids for the winter. At least dear old dad has finally agreed to get a computer to keep them connected to the outside world! Otherwise, their cozy Vineyard home is pretty much cut off from civilization during this time of year. <br> Still, the world has a way of intruding on their idyllic winter setting. When J.W.'s old Vietnam buddy and Vineyard fishing companion, Joe Begay, asks to be met on Cape Cod and virtually smuggled back to the island, J.W. knows something's not right. Joe wouldn't be sneaking around and asking J.W. to do him odd favors if trouble weren't brewing. J.W. also knows that Begay wasn't merely a soldier, but he has also performed highly secretive work for the government ever since Vietnam. <br> Soon, the facts begin to emerge: A few years ago, Begay and five fellow agents were caught in the chaos of a bloody mission. Today, only two of the five remain. The others have died unexpectedly, and a killer known as the Easter Bunny may now be on his way to the island to take out Joe Begay. <br> Enter the seductive and highly dangerous Kate MacLeod, the fifth member of Begay's secret government team. Why has Kate suddenly appeared on the Vineyard? Is she there to warn Begay, or could she be there to kill him? Even though Begay claims to trust her, J.W. is sticking close to Kate's side to make sure his friend is not being double-crossed. <br> J.W. has always admired and respected Begay, and would do anything to help him out -- but he can't let Zee and the kids become targets in this cat-and-mouse game. Can J.W. divert the Bunny's attention long enough for Begay to take him out? And can he keep his family out of harm's way?</p><p>The late Philip R. Craig was the author of nineteen novels in the Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard Mystery series. A professor emeritus of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he loved the Vineyard and lived there year-round with his wife, Shirley.This long-running series offers many satisfactions, not the least of which is Craig's constants: J. W., striving mightily to be a fisherman and family man but always being drawn into whatever mischief is afoot on Martha's Vineyard; plots that don't stretch credulity; and fine local color. This time, with Christmas approaching, J. W. finds it necessary to move his wife and kids out of their house when an old Indian buddy from Vietnam needs to hide his tracks for awhile. Joe Begay has done covert work for some years, and when three of the five operators who worked with him die suddenly, he sends his own family away and asks J. W. to help. A beautiful Eurasian agent, a lot of suits from D.C., and J. W.'s tentative forays onto the Internet (aided by his young children) all come into play, as our hero attempts to resolve the situation in time for his family to return home for the holidays. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Rick Mears won four Indianapolis 500s between 1979-1991 as well as three CART Indy car championships before retiring at the end of 1992 when he realized that a series of injuries had conspired to reduce his ability to operate at the maximum and to enjoy his sport to the fullest. Mears is one of very few great sportsmen who retired at the height of his career in the immediate aftermath of some of his greatest performances.&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally, when Rick stepped out of the cockpit he enjoyed a superlative reputation as one of the cleanest, most sportsmanlike race car drivers the world has ever known. &#x201c;He was very polished,&#x201d; says Mario Andretti in the book&#x2019;s Prologue. &#x201c;He was probably one of the most correct drivers out there to race against. I always had the greatest respect for Rick Mears.&#x201d;&nbsp; Rick&#x2019;s story begins in Kansas in the post-WWII years where his mom and dad, Skip and Bill, were born and raised. Bill was an auto mechanic who loved to race and with his young wife&#x2019;s complete support Bill became a very successful, weekend short track racer across Kansas and Oklahoma before migrating west to California in 1955 and settling in Bakersfield with his young family. Pretty soon, Skip and Bill&#x2019;s sons, Roger and Rick, were racing; older brother Roger in stock cars and Rick on motorcycles. Bill supported their passion wholeheartedly, providing the motivation, shop, equipment and know-how to build his boys race cars and in the early seventies the &#x2018;Mears Gang&#x2019; &#x2013;as they became known &#x2020;seriously made their mark in Southern California sprint buggy and off-road racing. Both of them also tackled Pike&#x2019;s Peak and won. Roger and Rick had different driving styles and personalities. Roger was an aggressive racer, like his father had been, while Rick was more laid-back, more analytical. Neither of them dreamed of becoming serious, professional racers, but in 1976 Rick got his big break thanks to safety equipment man Bill Simpson who gave Rick his first Indy car ride. Simpson saw the rare talent Rick possessed and got Mears&#x2019; Indy car career rolling before handing his contract with Rick over to Roger Penske at no cost in the fall of 1977.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rick became a Penske driver in 1978 and scored his first win in his third race with the team. He went on to win the 1979 Indy 500 and CART championship and establish an enduring relationship with Penske that lasted through and beyond his retirement from driving at the end of 1992. Ultimately, he won four Indy 500s (equalling the record set by A.J. Foyt and Al Unser), three CART championships and twenty-nine Indy car races, and was admired and respected not only as a superb driver and racer but as a rare gentleman on and off the track.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, brother Roger went on to race Indy cars for a few years before focusing his career on off-road racing where he was an extremely successful owner/driver. And the &#x2018;Mears Gang&#x2019; tradition carries on today with Roger&#x2019;s son Casey racing in NASCAR&#x2019;s Sprint Cup series with the all-powerful Hendrick Motorsports Team where he&#x2019;s teamed with Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In &#x2018;Rick Mears � Thanks&#x2019;, veteran racing writer Gordon Kirby, the U.S. editor of Motor Sport, tells the whole story of Rocket Rick Mears and the Mears Gang&#x2019;s journey from dirt tracks to superspeedways. And the book also shows us how a sportsman or woman should behave as a professional and as a human being.&nbsp; Enjoy the read and the ride.</p><p>Gordon Kirby is one of the world&#x2019;s most widely-read and respected motor racing writers.

The biography throws new light on Beckett&#39;s stormy relationship with his mother, the psychotherapy he received after the death of his father and his crucial relationship with James Joyce. There is also material on Beckett&#39;s six-month visit to Germany as the Nazi&#39;s tightened their grip. The book includes unpublished material on Beckett&#39;s personal life after he chose to live in France, including his own account of his work for a Resistance cell during the war, his escape from the Gestapo and his retreat into hiding. Obsessively private, Beckett was wholly committed to the work which eventually brought his public fame, beginning with the controversial success of &#34;Waiting for Godot&#34; in 1953, and culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969.

Very good condition with only minor signs of external wear. From the library of philosopher Graham Parkes, with his name on the front free endpaper. Edited and with a Commentary by Kay Parkhurst Easson and Roger R. Easson. William Blake was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. His prophetic poetry has been said to form what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language. His visual artistry led one contemporary art critic to proclaim him far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced. While Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. William Butler Yeats, who edited an edition of Blake&#39;s collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas, while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake&#39;s conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland. His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams, who set his works. Blake&#39;s thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung. In Jung&#39;s own words: Blake a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes. Similarly, although less popularly, Diana Hume George claimed that Blake can be seen as a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud. (Amazon)</p><p>Imaged from The Lessing J.

According to Lind (The Next American Nation, LJ 6/1/95), such an interpretation of nationalism, especially in the U.S. context, is inaccurate and insufficient. Nationalism, Lind contends, is neither dirty nor un-American but has deep and positive roots in American soil, producing a rich country domestically and a powerful one internationally. To a large degree, Lind is on target, for central to the American political and intellectual tradition is the idea of the nation, as exemplified in the thought and practice of the likes of Hamilton, Lincoln, and the Roosevelts. Such Hamiltonian visionary nationalism, Lind argues, is essential for recovering our civic culture and realizing the purposes of our polity as expressed in the preamble to the Constitution. His book must be encountered in the ongoing debate about the health of our body politic.

He developed the field of progression hypnotherapy, and his book Past Lives, Future Lives is the first book ever written on progression hypnotherapy. His book The Search For Grace was made into a CBS movie. Dr. Goldberg has been interviewed on Oprah, Regis, Montel, Jerry Springer, CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, Art Bell and George Noory, and many others.The concept of reversing the aging process naturally should inspire almost everyone. Who wouldn't want to learn techniques that could significantly alter the bodily changes that are synonymous with growing older? Dr. Goldberg, an alternative medicine practitioner since 1974, introduces the concept of "youthing" which combines meditative techniques including self-hypnosis, with exercise and nutritional analysis, for the end result of living a longer and happier life. While Goldberg points out that scientists estimate humans to have the capability of living to be at least 120 years old, the average age that Americans live today is only 75. This discrepancy can be attributed, according to Goldberg, to simply accepting an outdated theory that getting old is unavoidable and the ravages to our bodies merely a fact of life. Goldberg dispels this belief, insisting that by incorporating a proactive approach to life, high blood pressure, wrinkles, weight problems, heart problems, and many diseases can be prevented. The recurrent tone of this book is upbeat and encouraging. The author's research is extensive, based on gerontology, biochemistry, and genetics. His exercise segment lists calisthenics, weight training, and cardiovascular routines for the reader, and the nutritional segment gives a variety of diets including a Very Low Calorie (VLC) diet which Goldberg believes might help for longevity. The important concept of self-hypnosis is detailed at length, offering the end result of peace and spiritual rejuvenation. A fulfilling book to read for those of us who would like to snub our noses at the idea of getting old. Enjoying each moment of life and utilizing some of the positive approaches to living well listed in this book are far more rewarding ways to live life to the fullest. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Chinese Menu Cookbook</h2><p>Here is a Chinese cookbook that not only gives you an introductory course in the cuisine but also sensibly approaches the issue of coordinating dishes in a Chinese meal.

Written in an easy-to-follow format, you will enjoy studying Scripture insights that are faithful to the Wesleyan-Armenian perspective.</p></p><p>In a world where image is everything, the Epistle of James calls Christians to "get real!" Author J. Michael Walters echoes James's cry that "virtual spirituality" cannot sustain authentic faith. The call to "true religion," as Walters labels it, is a call to arms for every disciple and discipler of our day. <p>Walters reminds us that few aspects of the human experience are as prone to being phony as is religious faith. Christianity can become a matter of believing certain things without any real effect on the rest of life. There must be a recovery of authenticity in people's faith practices and a total commitment of their hearts to God. That is the intent of this epistle. James means to call his readers home. </p><p>As one schooled in the disciplines of pastoral ministry, Walters identifies in the epistle's writer a pastor's heart filled with conviction and compassion. James has gained a well-deserved reputation for presenting a no-nonsense approach to Christianity. He minces no words as he calls his readers back to the foundations of an authentic, biblical faith. Back to true religion, as opposed to the empty hype of pretend religion. Back to the practice of wholehearted spirituality that has characterized the authentic people of God from the beginning.</p>J. Michael Walters, D.Min., is a professor of Christian ministries, the director of ministerial education, and preacher-in-residence at Houghton College in Houghton, NY.

He later started a Macintosh software company and is currently a marketing consultant and columnist for <i>MacUser Magazine.</i> He has a BA from Stanford University and an MBA from the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>Kawasaki, a writer, consultant, entrepreneur, and former product manager for Apple Computers, offers a new selling concept that he calls "evangelism." He defines this as "the process of convincing people to believe in your product or idea as much as you do." Drawing on his own experiences promoting the Macintosh computer and the case studies of both profit and nonprofit organizations, Kawasaki analyzes the characteristics of successful evangelists. Among them are: MaryAnne Schreder's Centre for Living and Dying, Mary Furlong's SeniorNet, Anna Roddick's The Body Shop, and Bob Hall, manager of product planning research for Mazda. Kawasaki presents guidelines for finding a cause, preparing a plan, writing promotional material, and recruiting and training.

Her groundbreaking debut novel, From Doon With Death, was first published in 1964 and introduced the reader to her enduring and popular detective, Inspector Reginald Wexford, who went on to feature in twenty-four of her subsequent novels. With worldwide sales of approximately 20 million copies, Rendell was a regular Sunday Times bestseller. Her sixty bestselling novels include police procedurals, some of which have been successfully adapted for TV, stand-alone psychological mysteries, and a third strand of crime novels under the pseudonym Barbara Vine. Very much abreast of her times, the Wexford books in particular often engaged with social or political issues close to her heart. Rendell won numerous awards, including the Crime Writers&#39; Association Gold Dagger for 1976&#39;s best crime novel with A Demon in My View, a Gold Dagger award for Live Flesh in 1986, and the Sunday Times Literary Award in 1990. In 2013 she was awarded the Crime Writers&#39; Association Cartier Diamond Dagger for sustained excellence in crime writing. In 1996 she was awarded the CBE and in 1997 became a Life Peer. Ruth Rendell died in May 2015. Her final novel, Dark Corners, is scheduled for publication in October 2015&#34;Rendell understands the nature of evil...

Would you call the cops? Call a psychiatrist? Call out for pizza? When two such teachers appeared before Gary Renard in 1992, he chose to listen to them (and ask a lot of questions). The result is this startling book: an extraordinary record of 17 mind bending conversations that took place over nearly a decade, reorienting the author&#39;s life and giving the world an uncompromising introduction to a spiritual teaching destined to change human history.</p><p>Read by Gary Renard &amp; Doreen Virtue, Phd!While living in a rural area of Maine I was witness to a series of in-the-flesh appearances by two ascended masters named Pursah and Arten, who eventually identified their previous incarnations as including those of Saint Thomas and Saint Thaddaeus. (Despite popular myth, those lifetimes as two of the original disciples were not their final ones.) My visitors did not come forth in order to repeat some of the spiritual platitudes that many people already believe. Rather, they revealed no less than the secrets of the universe, discussed the true purpose of life, and spoke in detail about The Gospel of Thomas. They also clarified the principles of an astounding spiritual document that will usher in a new way of thinking that will become more prevalent in the new millennium. <p>You don&#x2019;t have to believe these appearances took place in order to derive benefits from the information in this book. However, I can vouch for the extreme unlikeliness of this book being written by an uneducated layman such as myself without inspiration by these masters. At any rate, I leave it up to readers to think whatever they choose about the book&#x2019;s origins. </p><p>I personally believe that The Disappearance of the Universe can be helpful, time-saving reading for any open-minded person who is on a spiritual path. After you experience this message, it may be impossible for you &#x2014; as it was for me &#x2014; ever to look at your life or think of the universe the same way again.</p></p><h2>Where&#39;s My Tushy?</h2><p><p>"In one little town (it is sad but it's true),<br> The tushies left town without leaving a clue."<br> What happens when all the tushies in an unusual town decide to take a vacation?</p></p><p><p><strong>Ivica Stevanovic</strong> has illustrated numerous picture books, as well as book covers and graphic novels. He lives in Veternik, Serbia, with his wife, who is also a children&#x2019;s illustrator, and their daughter.</p><p>"There is nothing funnier to children in this age group than books that use words like 'underwear' and 'tushy.' Perhaps it is because they are words you really aren't supposed to say in polite company. To hear them in a book, then, makes them comfortably naughty. This is a story about tushies that feel they have been overlooked and taken for granted. Collectively, they decide to leave and go on vacation. All this is written in rhyme, a style that grabs young readers and listeners, and the illustrations are colorful and cartoony. The behinds realize that they miss everyone and head back to town, where they are unceremoniously reunited with the rest of their bodies. While readers will be glad to learn of the reunion, the ending is abrupt and the whole package may just be too silly for some. Still, <strong>children love funny books, and this one will get many of them chuckling.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Playful rhyming couplets reveal the necessity of backsides.</p> <p>You'd think it'd be cushy to write about tushies. You'd think it'd be easy to please. Instead, it's a chore. The effort's a bore, and rhyming takes real expertise. Aronson pulls it off in this jaunty picture book enlivened by humorous cartoons featuring chubby, shmoo-like figures dressed in an amazing variety of underwear. When all the tushies in town decide their lives are 'too tough' and take off for vacation at the beach, people discover just how important these body parts are in their lives. Their clothes won't stay up, and they can't sit down. There's no real narrative arc here. The rumps run away, romp in the sun and then return, while their owners worry and wonder where they've gone. The couplets, often set as quatrains, sit directly on the illustrations, many of which are double-page spreads that expand the story. Stevanovic's ink-and-watercolor illustrations, digitally enhanced, show unhappy townsfolk making do with pillows and suspenders while detectives and police carry on their investigation and the runaways enjoy the shore. A wraparound cover sets the stage, depicting the bums escaping into the night.</p> <p><strong>Captain Underpants look-alikes return with a caper sure to tickle preschool funny bones at storytime.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Wonder</h2><p>&#34;Tourists flock to the cabin of eleven-year-old Anna O&#39;Donnell, who is said to be living without food, and a journalist is sent to cover the sensation.

As Anna&#39;s life ebbs away, Lib finds herself responsible not just for the care of a child but for that child&#39;s very survival. Haunting and magnetic, The Wonder is a searing examination of doubt, faith, and what nourishes us, body and soul. Written with all the propulsive tension that made Donoghue&#39;s Room a huge bestseller, it works beautifully on many levels -- an intimate tale of two strangers who transform each other&#39;s lives, a powerful psychological thriller, and a spellbinding story of love pitted against evil.&#34;--Back cover</p><p>Born in Dublin in 1969, Emma Donoghue is an Irish emigrant twice over: she spent eight years in Cambridge doing a PhD in eighteenth-century literature before moving to London, Ontario, where she lives with her partner and their two children. She also migrates between genres, writing literary history, biography, stage and radio plays as well as fairy tales and short stories. She is best known for her novels, which range from the historical (<em>Frog Music, Slammerkin</em>, <i>Life Mask</i>, <i>Landing</i>, <i>The Sealed Letter</i>) to the contemporary (<i>Stir-Fry</i>, <i>Hood</i>, <i>Landing</i>). Her international bestseller <i>Room</i> was a <i>New York Times </i>Best Book of 2010 and was a finalist for the Man Booker, Commonwealth, and Orange Prizes."Fascinating....

Vishniac, a Russian Jew, began to take photographs of village life during World War I, when Russian Jews who lived near the front were accused of being German spies and were deported to Siberia. He later moved to Germany, where he witnessed the horrible events of Kristallnacht and the anti-Jewish legislation that allowed Hitler to declare his enemies stateless and therefore unworthy of international protection. As we study Vishniac's photographs--a surviving fraction of the more than 16,000 he took--we are aware that we are seeing the faces of those soon to die, witnessing a world that has all but perished. Yet that world, of shops and schools, of busy streets and quiet farms, remains with us if only as a ghostly memory, thanks in part to Vishniac's compassionate eye.</p><h2>A Kiss of Adventure (Treasures of the Heart, No. 1)</h2><p>The Treasures of the Heart series are fast-paced contemporary romance adventure novels.

If a playground is the ideal place for exploring new horizons and skimming over such hurdles as boundaries and dead ends, then Anno has simply replaced play-blocks with spatial dimensions, constructing mazes of up-and-down and right-and-left, criss-crossing staircases that lead nowhere, loops of endless motion and varied perspective, oceanic vastness pouring out of an open bottle and intricate networks of roads, cars and traffic signs. In the last spread, the artist literally borrows from M. C. Escher's Waterfall ; the whole wordless book is a variation on Escher's theme of infinite loops and conceptual space. Children will wholeheartedly welcome Anno's elfin, dancing-on-the-ceiling troops and will treasure this book as an unlimited source of entertaining wackiness and thought-provoking fun.

But this trip in and around the lands of the Pacific may be his boldest, most fascinating yet. From New Zealand's rain forests, to crocodile-infested New Guinea, over isolated atolls, through dirty harbors, daring weather and coastlines, he travels by Kayak wherever the winds take him--and what he discovers is the world to explore and try to understand.</p><p>PAUL THEROUX&nbsp;is the author of many highly acclaimed books. His novels include <i>The Lower River</i> and <i>The Mosquito Coast,</i> and his renowned travel books include <i>Ghost Train to the Eastern Star</i> and <i>Dark Star Safari</i>. He lives in Hawaii and Cape Cod.The peripatetic author of Riding the Iron Rooster, etc., etc., ventures with a collapsible kayak to the remote and scattered islands of the South Pacific. With a farewell to his marriage, and loneliness at his back, Theroux begins his extraordinary mission in New Zealand's Fiordland (``As long as there is wilderness there is hope''), moves on to Australia (a continent ``terrified by its own emptiness''), and then to Melanesia, Polynesia--Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Tahiti, New Guinea's Trobriands, etc.--and, finally, Hawaii. He paddles the sea, he says, in the wake of myth-makers Melville, Stevenson, Gauguin, Maugham, and the Frenchman Captain Bougainville, who, in 1768, believed he'd found not only the Garden of Eden but Venus when a ``barebreasted Tahitian girl'' climbed into his ship from a canoe. To keen-eyed Theroux, the Polynesian islands are ``pleasant and feckless'' but far from paradise. Even Gauguin's Marquesas are ``dramatic at a distance'' but ``close up--muddy and jungly and priest-ridden.'' Traditional islands are ``riddled with magic, superstition, myths, dangers, rivalries and its old routines.'' Always interesting are Theroux's encounters with archaeologists who have disproved Thor Heyerdahl's popularizing theories about Polynesia. Sifting through human and animal bones, they study a still-mysterious people who carved some 800 stone statues on Easter Island and who boasted navigational skills that sent them migrating during what was Europe's Dark Ages. A sense of being beyond the reach of civilization comes when, in his intrepid kayak, off Easter Island and between the rock-battering surf and the Pacific, Theroux removes his headphones, ``hears the immense roar of waves and the screaming wind,'' and is terrified. A vast and contemplative book, seeing the ``Pacific as a universe, and the islands like stars in all that space.'' Informative not only for the voyager, but also for those wanting a new perspective on the Western continents of home. (Sorely lacking a map.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is a Broadway Actor and frequent television guest star and leading man in made-for-TV movies. He is also an Audie Award winning narrator of audiobooks.<i>Starred Review.</i> Willis makes brilliant short fiction look easy in this collection of 23 novellas and short stories, which display a powerful range of sensibility, from poignant tenderness (Inn) and heartbreak (Samaritan) to close-to-the-bone satire (Even the Queen) and blackest savagery (All My Darling Daughters). The title novella illustrates many of Willis's strengths. Starting from some inexplicable meteorological phenomenon like a blast of fetid air no one else in London's Tube tunnels can feel or smell, The Winds of Marble Arch whirls its hapless narrator through one strange event after another, until finally his troubled marriage reaches an otherwise impossible transformation into leaves and lilacs and love. A bizarre snowstorm leads to a whole new fast-cut understanding of Christmas in Just Like the Ones We Used to Know, and another eerie blizzard brings the collection to a masterful close in Epiphany, opening a door between our puny reality and the Great Carnival around and above us all, even though we rarely perceive it. Willis's gift promises that signs are everywhere; we just have to learn to recognize them. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Peter Hupalo, author of &#34;Thinking Like An Entrepreneur&#34; and the owner of HCM Publishing, teaches the business aspects involved in operating a small book publishing company. &#34;How To Start And Run A Small Book Publishing Company&#34; will help you understand: Inventory Accounting In The Book Trade; Just-In-Time Inventory Management; Turn-Key Fulfillment Solutions; Tax Deductible Costs In Publishing; The Basics Of Sales And Use Tax; Profitable Book Pricing; Standard Terms In The Book Industry; Working With Distributors And Wholesalers; Cover Design And Book Layout; Book Promotion And Marketing; How To Select Profitable Authors To Publish; The Printing Process; Printing On Demand (POD); The Power Of A Strong Backlist; How To Value A Copyright; And Much More!</p><p>From The Author &amp; Publisher: <p>I wrote "How To Start And Run A Small Book Publishing Company: A Small Business Guide To Self-Publishing And Independent Publishing" to help new publishers understand the publishing business. </p><p>There are already several great self-publishing books, and my goal wasn't to provide another survey of nearly everything a new publisher must know to get a book produced. My book focuses more upon specific details, often overlooked by new publishers as they start-up and grow. </p><p>For example, I write about book distributor bankruptcy and protecting yourself in the event that your book distributor goes bankrupt. This is a topic not covered in most introductions to self-publishing. It's much more fun to read about how some self-publisher sold one million books and became a bestselling author than it is to read about distributor bankruptcy. </p><p>Yet, understanding distributor bankruptcy is important. Many small publishers have experienced a bankruptcy of their distributor. In some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory and tens of thousands of dollars in accounts receivable, owed to the self-publisher, are at stake. Taking the proper precautions can mean the difference between your self-publishing company losing substantial amounts of money and, possibly, going bankrupt or recovering easily. </p><p>Because many people who choose to self-publish a book are creative types with little business experience, I also address topics, such as inventory accounting, tax deductibility of complimentary book copies given away, record keeping, sales and use tax, business structure (Should you operate as a corporation or as a sole proprietor?, dealing with estimated tax payments, etc.), and other business aspects of running a publishing company. I discuss outsourcing fulfillment so that you can run a small publishing company from your home while selling a substantial number of books. </p><p>Intermediate and advanced publishers will also benefit from reading "How To Start And Run A Small Book Publishing Company." Topics that will appeal to more experienced publishers include copyright valuation (in the event that you wish to sell your book to a big publisher or acquire the rights to a book), book marketing, and thoughts on selecting profitable authors to publish. </p><p>People starting with a limited budget will find my book useful. I discuss some of the many options to produce a book in smaller quantities using printing on demand (POD) and digital printing technology. I include a discussion of Ingram POD service, for example, because Ingram is a key distributor, distributing about 175 million books annually. New publishers will find that getting distribution by Ingram is extremely difficult. Ingram Lightning Source is one option to get distribution by Ingram. </p><p>The table of contents gives more detail about the topics covered in "How To Start And Run A Small Book Publishing Company." I hope you enjoy the book and find it useful.

Many are now enjoying their seventies and eighties together after more than fifty happy years of marriage. <br><br>They met in many remarkable ways, some in the briefest of chance encounters, and their love endured heart-rending ordeals of long separation and the constant threat that a husband or lover might not return. As these couples reflect on the profound experience of the war, the stories they most like to tell are of the deep bonds they forged during that tumultuous time, bonds so strong that they lasted a lifetime. As one man put it, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all got war stories. Some of us like to tell them and some don&#x2019;t. But the story of how we fell in love with our wives, well, that&#x2019;s still with us every day, and I know a lot of us can still get a little choked up over it.

The stories reflect a wonderful range of experiences, from couples who met and got married within a few weeks to those who waited years after a brief first meeting to see each other again. There are stories of falling in love at first sight, stories of tragedy transformed by love, and stories of the remarkable resourcefulness that can be exercised by two people determined to be together. <br><br>A treasure trove of unique reminiscences, <b>Love Stories of World War II</b> offers an unprecedented view into this personal side of the World War II experience and celebrates the incredible legacy of remarkable relationships forged in the midst of tragedy.</p><p>Larry King is the Emmy Award&#x2013;winning host of Larry King Live on CNN and the author of several bestselling books.

War had been raging across Europe for over two years, ever since Adolf Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, but strong isolationist feelings dominated in the United States. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had to muster all of his considerable cunning in order to convince Congress to institute the first peacetime draft in American history in September 1940. But with the ruthless attack on Pearl Harbor, America plunged into the war. Thousands of young couples got married over the next few months, in order to have some time together before the husband was inevitably called to duty.<br><br><b>Miles and Betty Trimpey </b><br><br>In 1998 Betty Trimpey gave her younger daughter, Linda K. Golby, a battered box of letters that had survived thirteen moves, still tied together with faded fifty-year-old hair ribbons. The letters included many that Linda's father, Miles Reid Trimpey, had written to his young wife during World War II, Betty's own letters back to him, as well as a number written to Miles by relatives and friends.<br><br>After she saw the Steven Spielberg movie Saving Private Ryan, Linda began wondering whether her father had been involved in the D-Day landings at Normandy. He never talked about the war before his death in 1990, and she had no idea where he served. She discovered from one letter that he indeed scrambled to the beach at Normandy that horrifying day, and spent his nineteenth birthday in a foxhole after the battle at Trévières on June 9, 1944, three days after D-Day One.<br><br>Increasingly intrigued, Linda read through all the letters and decided to type them up and assemble them in two loose-leaf volumes. She illustrated the volumes with photographs and reproductions of postcards and holiday greetings her father sent to her mother while he was in the army. She also included a number of documents pertaining to his service and annotated the top of each letter in her own elegant handwriting, explaining who had sent each letter and providing the postmark date and place. Over the following months, she also read all the letters aloud to her mother, whose eyesight had failed. The letters conjured up such vivid memories of fear and separation for Betty that the reading sessions often became extremely emotional. Linda, too, was deeply moved, as she was getting to know her father in ways she never had before.<br><br>Her father's letters were not very legible, written mostly in pencil on any paper he could get his hands on, including one on toilet tissue. Some gave the impression that a hard but not very flat surface-his helmet, his knee-was used as a writing desk. Betty maintained that she felt bad about writing her husband such boring letters, but Linda is certain that her small talk was exactly what her father needed and wanted to hear. Those letters served as his primary connection to the world he was fighting for and longed to come home to. Linda believes that the letters he sent and received actually kept him sane.<br><br>Miles trimpey and Betty Romesberg both grew up near Rockwood, Pennsylvania. Betty lived with her parents on a small farm, and Miles worked in construction. They met one Saturday night when both were dining with friends at the same restaurant. Betty always told her two daughters, Nancy Lee and Linda, that it was love at first sight, and Miles would say that he had thought Betty was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen in his life and that he knew instantly that he would marry her someday.<br><br>On their first date, Miles took Betty to the construction site where he was working, to show her that he was a hardworking, serious young man. In fact, he was only seventeen, and Betty eighteen. They soon married, on April 14, 1943. Because Miles expected to be drafted shortly after he turned eighteen, they moved in with Betty's parents instead of trying to find their own place. They also decided to have a baby right away. Miles wanted to have at least one child in case he didn't make it home from the war, and Betty agreed.<br><br>On June 9, 1943, Miles turned eighteen, and sure enough, the notice to report for induction (Order #12,472) was issued on September 13. He became an enlisted man on October 19 and was sent to Camp Wheeler, Georgia, for basic training. As soon as he got to camp, he started writing the letters that Betty prized so much.<br><br>In a letter from Camp Wheeler dated October 22, Miles told Betty that they had watched a movie show at the camp. "They were no good," he wrote, "but if I had you with me they would be better." On October 28, he noted, "I had to stop this letter just now. We were called out for a little training. We had to learn to salute an oficer."<br><br>Training quickly got serious. In a November 4 letter, Miles told Betty that he had bought her a souvenir, a miniature replica of the automatic rifle he had been trained to use: "It shoots eight shells as fast as you can pull the trigger. Take notice of the knife on the end. They showed us how to kill a man with it today. You use the knife if you don't have any shells. The knife is 16* long. You run it through the neck or through the guts."<br><br>As if realizing that this description might upset Betty, he started a new paragraph: "To change the subject I want to thank you for the Bible you sent me. I will use it and often." Betty still has that small blue Bible, a bit tattered from its wartime service. On the flyleaf he inscribed his name, rank, and serial number, and listed Mrs. Miles Trimpey, Rockwood, Pa, R.D. #1, Box 6, as his nearest relative. On the opposite page was a printed note from the White House: "As Commander-in-Chief I take pleasure in commending the reading of the Bible to all who serve in the armed forces of the United States," it begins, and it is signed Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is clear from Miles's letters that he did use that Bible often and, like many others, learned to pray with considerably more urgency while serving in the war. As for the souvenir gun, Betty wrote to tell him that it was beautiful, and that she had placed it on her bureau as he had asked.<br><br>As the seventeen weeks of training continued, Miles wrote as often as possible, practically daily, but sometimes he was too exhausted to do anything but collapse at the end of the day. His letters are suffused with love for Betty and his concern about how she was feeling as her pregnancy advanced. (The word "pregnant" was not used by either of them; Betty spoke instead of "my condition," as proper young women were taught to do sixty years ago.)<br><br>There was discussion of Betty coming down to Georgia to see Miles, because he would not be able to come home for Thanksgiving or Christmas, but both finances and her "condition" prevented that. Miles did not get his first pay, which, after the allotment sent home to Betty was $15 for the month he had served, until November 30, and it was thanks only to dollar bills sent by relatives that he was able to buy much of anything. Betty and other family members and friends also sent him treats like candy and nuts. At one point he asked Betty to send him some "cigs," and more than once he wryly noted, "Another day, another 60 cents." When he did get paid, he went out and had his picture taken in uniform to send to Betty. It arrived with the frame and glass broken, despite his careful wrapping. In response, Betty offered some wifely advice about marking any other pictures "Glass, Handle with Care" or, even better, sending just the photo marked "Picture, Do Not Bend" and letting her buy a frame. But even with a broken frame, she loved the photo and wrote to him, "Boy are you ever good-looking."<br><br>When the couple exchanged Christmas letters, Betty wrote that it surely didn't feel like Christmas without him. After describing the family feast, she commented, "I wasn't very hungry for any food. All I was hungry for is your love." Miles described his meal, including turkey and pumpkin pie and "most everything we could think of," adding, "The only time you get a good meal in the Army is Thanksgiving or Christmas." He closed by telling her, "I hear 'White Christmas' playing. Does it ever bring back the good old days. I feel like crying. No fooling. Your True Husband, Miles."<br><br>Army realities soon returned to the foreground. In a letter written on the twenty-ninth, Miles complained, "We got a new sergeant yesterday and is he ever hell on earth." It was already clear that he would be "going over," using the phrase for European combat that was initiated during World War I. For a while, Miles had written about trying to join the paratroopers, but when he asked Betty what she thought, she firmly discouraged the idea, since his situation was likely to be dangerous enough without any leaping out of planes.<br><br>Like all soldiers, Miles was well aware that he could easily get killed. In his Christmas Day letter, he wrote, "So, Darling, never worry if anything happens to me and I never get back. Always think of these words, 'I will be in Heaven waiting for you, Darling.'" But however much he may have worried about what could happen to him, other letters make clear his pride in being a good soldier, and his delight that his unit had been singled out by an officer as the best around.<br><br>As his training drew to a grueling close, Miles had to spend two weeks living in a tent in the woods while his unit was put through combat exercises. Despite the cold and rain and lack of sleep, he was sustained by the hope that at the end of his training, he would get a week's leave to go north and be with Betty. The leave he prayed for came through at the end of February, and he was able to spend the first week of March w...</p><h2>The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde</h2><p>In a fictionalized autobiography, the controversial British writer considers the accomplishments and misfortunes of his life</p><p></p><h2>Dictionary of the Old Testament Pentateuch: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship (Mind Association Occasional)</h2><p>Examines the major themes of the first five books of the Old Testament.</p><p>Baker (A.B., M.C.S., M.Phil., Ph.D.) is professor of Old Testament and Semitic languages at Ashland Theological Seminary in Ashland, Ohio.

As commander of the Division of the Missouri from 1865 to 1869 and General of the Army of the United States under President Grant from 1869 to 1883, Sherman facilitated expansion and settlement in the West while suppressing the raids of the Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Kiowa, Comanche, and Crow Indians.

All that changes when his girlfriend Mindy is viciously beaten into a coma and left to die on the snow-covered streets of Brooklyn. Suddenly, Moe has purpose.

Coleman has won multiple awards for his gritty but soulful series, and this entry is of that same high caliber. Don't miss it." --<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Coleman's latest - a prequel to the award-winning Moe Prager series - is a slam-dunk recommendation for readers drawn to smart, gritty, crime fiction with label-defying characters. Coleman . . . nicely balanc[es] plot and action." --<i>Booklist</i>, <b>Starred Review</b><br><br>"Edgar-finalist Coleman's outstanding eighth Moe Prager mystery (after 2011's <i>Hurt Machine</i>) explains how the NYPD detective turned PI became a cop.

It's a book that many Moe fans will enjoy. It's also one that newcomers might find interesting and, in case they don't already know, there's a lot to come if they become hooked." --<i>Sea Minor</i> blog<br><br>"For long-time fans of Prager and creator Reed Farrel Coleman, the novel sheds a new and welcome dimension on a long-admired and much-beloved protagonist. It provides a sharp and clearly defined literary snapshot of a tumultuous era . . . The element that I enjoyed most about the book was the manner in which it presented its host of street characters, all of whom had real-life counterparts in the life of anyone who was of age during the 1960s . . . <i>Onion Street</i> is worth reading for that reason alone." --BookReporter.com<br><br>"Coleman . . . use[s] the late Sixties, as well as [his] prose poet style, to look at [his] characters in fresh and exciting ways." --<i>Mystery People</i><br><br>"The bones of this story is your typical noir, though Coleman, the master of the twist, never lets the story stray into formula. This story is very organic, and several details resonated with me. Freed from the constraints of a series, Coleman has written what is probably his best novel yet." --<i>Edged in Blue</i><br><br>"A satisfying addition to the series, demonstrating Coleman's trademark humor, twisty plotting, well-developed characters, and an evocative and authentic portrait of the author's beloved Brooklyn.

Moe&#x2019;s various actions can be questioned, while his intentions are always honorable. All in all, it is a very human saga, and we get to know Moe a lot better in a serious way. Recommended." --<i>Spinetingler Magazine</i></p><h2>A Natural History of Human Emotions</h2><p>The author of Out of It: A Cultural History of Intoxication tackles human emotion, exploring the ten basic human emotions that shape personality and identity, blending insights from philosophy, science, history, and popular culture.</p><p>Even though a Chinese audience hearing Electra sing her poignant lamentation song would not understand her words, they would immediately recognize her emotion. And in the universal recognizability of sadness and nine other human emotions, Walton sees evidence of the validity of Darwin's groundbreaking <i>Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i> (1873), where the great naturalist argues that evolutionary development has biologically inscribed six fundamental emotions into human instincts. Walton extends Darwin's work by adding four more emotions to his taxonomy and by probing the psychological dynamics of each within a range of cultural contexts. An impressive wealth of scholarship helps readers define each emotion and understand how humans experience--and provoke--it. Though he assumes primal origins for all of the emotions examined, Walton limns some remarkable shifts in their modern manifestation. Readers consider, for instance, the dubious transformation of shame during the twentieth century into a motive for sadomasochism. And despite his advocacy of free expression, Walton acknowledges the role of the moral virtues in preventing emotional eruptions. A study that will repeatedly spark shocks of self-recognition. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Through systematic exploration of the period's verbal and material culture as complementary art forms, Garner argues that in Anglo-Saxon England the arts of poetry and building emerged from the same cultural matrix. Not only did Anglo-Saxon builders and poets draw demonstrably from many of the same traditionally encoded motifs and images, but so rhetorically powerful was the period's architectural poetics that its expressive force continued in literature and architecture produced long after the Norman Conquest. Far from conceiving this inherited tradition as monolithic in nature, <i>Structuring Spaces</i> foregrounds the complex interface of orality and literacy as a nexus of varied and multivalent cultural traditions that influenced the production of texts and buildings alike. After establishing a model of architectural poetics based on oral theory and vernacular architecture, Garner explores fictionalized buildings in such works as <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Ruin</i>, architectural representation in Old English adaptations of Greek and Latin works, uses of architectural metaphor, and themes of buildings in Anglo-Saxon maxims, riddles, elegies, hagiographies, and charms. Her book draws on scholarship from art history, archaeology, anthropology, and architecture, as well as the great wealth of studies addressing the literature itself.</p> <p>"Detailing the deeply interconnected relationship of Anglo-Saxon oral poetics and the architectonics of constructed space in the period, Lori Garner's <i>Structuring Spaces</i> makes a significant contribution. Her ability to put the material culture of the period, despite the truly fragmentary nature of the surviving evidence, into a direct and mutually illuminating dialogue with the discourse of oral poetics is very impressive and of considerable value to scholars in the several fields of medieval literature, medieval architecture, and oral theory." --Mark C. Amodio, Vassar College</p> <p>"In this wide-ranging and lavishly-illustrated study, Lori Garner effectively aligns the established approach of oral poetics with insights from the emerging field of vernacular architecture. From Heorot to Grendel's mere, from the Mermedonian prison of <i>Andreas</i> to the nest of <i>The Phoenix</i>, from the Wife's earth-hall to Holofernes' tent, Garner's sensitive readings of the poetics of built spaces in Old English poetry open up new perspectives on "conventional" imagery that we only thought we knew how to read." --Charles D. Wright, University of Illinois</p></p><p>Lori Ann Garner is assistant professor of English at Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee.</p><h2>Mind Magic: The Ecstasy of Freeing Creative Power</h2><p>Mind Magic: The Ecstasy of Freeing Creative Power Paperback - 1998 by Bill Harvey (Author), Isaac Abrams (Illustrator)</p><p></p><h2>Right Moves: The Conservative Think Tank in American Political Culture Since 1945</h2><p>From the middle of the twentieth century, think tanks have played an indelible role in the rise of American conservatism. Positioning themselves against the alleged liberal bias of the media, academia, and the federal bureaucracy, conservative think tanks gained the attention of politicians and the public alike and were instrumental in promulgating conservative ideas. Yet, in spite of the formative influence these institutions have had on the media and public opinion, little has been written about their history. Here, Jason Stahl offers the first sustained investigation of the rise and historical development of the conservative think tank as a source of political and cultural power in the United States. <br><br>What we now know as conservative think tanks--research and public-relations institutions populated by conservative intellectuals--emerged in the postwar period as places for theorizing and "selling" public policies and ideologies to both lawmakers and the public at large. Stahl traces the progression of think tanks from their outsider status against a backdrop of New Deal and Great Society liberalism to their current prominence as a counterweight to progressive political institutions and thought. By examining the rise of the conservative think tank, Stahl makes invaluable contributions to our historical understanding of conservatism, public-policy formation, and capitalism.<br><br></p><p>Jason Stahl is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Organizational Leadership, Policy and Development at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.[A] diligently researched book [that] offers readers an informative account of the origins and rise of conservative think tanks in American politics.--<i>Washington Times</i><br>Offers a chilling analysis that rings true in diagnosing the current cast of routine political talk, the sphere in which devastating decisions are made.--<i>Journal of American History</i><br>Illuminates a larger social trend, which was the decline of faith in the ideals of 'objectivity' and 'disinterestedness' from the early 1960s through the early 1970s.--<i>H-Net Reviews</i><br>[A] provocative theory of recent policy debates.--<i>Washington Monthly</i><br><br></p><h2>Noodles: I Love Christmas (Scholastic Reader Level 1)</h2><p>An easy-to-read holiday story featuring bestselling Noodles, the little white dog!<br><br>It's Christmas, and the whole family is very busy.

In heartrending detail, we witness a struggle that unfolded at times before our own eyes, but which we failed to understand.</p><p>Leaming's biography also makes clear the pattern of Jackie's life as a whole. We see how a spirited young woman's rejection of a predictable life led her to John F. Kennedy and the White House, how she sought to reconcile the conflicts of her marriage and the role she was to play, and how the trauma of her husband's murder which left her soaked in his blood and brains led her to seek a very different kind of life from the one she'd previously sought.</p><p>A life story that has been scrutinized countless times, seen here for the first time as the serious and important story that it is. A story for our times at a moment when we as a nation need more than ever to understand the impact of trauma.</p></p><p>PTSD &amp; JACKIE KENNEDY by Barbara Leaming<br><br>Our country is in the midst of a national crisis over PTSD. Great numbers of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have returned suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet our society still understands very little about what PTSD is and the suffering it causes to those who live with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackie Kennedy's experience of PTSD is at the heart of my new biography,&nbsp;<i>Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: The Untold Story</i>.&nbsp; It is the reason I decided to write the book.<br><br>The story of Jackie's 31 year struggle with PTSD that I was able to detail and document--much of it seen from Jackie's own perspective, often in her own heartbreaking words--affords us an important chance to see up close and in vivid detail just what PTSD means to someone who has had a traumatic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also in a real sense a remarkable story of survival, the story of someone fighting for her sanity when no one understood what was wrong, when she was repeatedly under assault by society, and when the trauma was repeated. &nbsp;<br><br>Importantly, this is also a story which puts a name and face we know to the overwhelming reality of the suffering of someone afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp; Moreover, her trauma was also a national trauma, a trauma we all witnessed--the assassination of JFK in which Jackie was soaked in her husband's blood and brains.<br><br>Jackie Kennedy spent decades in the public eye, but it now becomes frighteningly clear how little we understood of what we saw.&nbsp; It is time to set the record straight. Jackie's story is both important history and a history for our time.<br><br>Of all the books I've written none has meant more to me in emotional terms and none has made me feel more acutely the responsibility I have in writing it--a responsibility not just to my subject herself but to those who are suffering from PTSD.BARBARA LEAMING is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author.

Speaking from a diverse range of ethnic, racial, and national sites, the contributors to this volume illustrate how queer identity in particular is affected in ways that are as varied and nuanced as the cultural, social, and physical environments themselves.<br> Incorporating literary analysis, ethnographic research, and theories of diaspora, migration, and transnationalism, the essays in this volume address an impressive range of topics, from the divergent medical and epidemiological understandings of the AIDS pandemic to 1950s lesbian pulp fiction. While one chapter focuses on the appropriation of religious ceremony by gay Filipino immigrants in New York City, another investigates the implicit connection between Jewishness and homosexuality in the work of Freud. The gendering of domestic roles in food preparation and consumption in Japanese society gives way to a discussion of Cuban and Jamaican homoeroticism as seen in the works of Reinaldo Arenas and Claude McKay. Chilean author D&#x2019;Halmar&#x2019;s orientalization of Spain as queer space and the hybrid nature of queer &#x2018;zine culture in Quebec are the subject of others. The collection concludes with a monologue by &#x201c;Walid,&#x201d; a young gay Arab living in the occupied territory, whose sexual and national identities change according to his sexual and social needs.<br> Illuminating the complex nature of queerness in the postmodern world, <i>Queer Diasporas</i> contributes to the advancement of gay and lesbian studies. It will be important to those working in cultural, literary, and postcolonial studies.<br><i><br>Contributors</i>.

Manalansan IV, Sylvia Molloy, Cindy Patton, Jacob Press, Jennifer Robertson, Benigno S�nchez-Eppler<br></p><p>&#x201c;To call this provocative collection wide-ranging would give new life to a clich�. The essays bring to the point of ignition all the friction between local sexualities and the dislocations of a globalizing world. These tensions, in examples of a fabulous variety, resonate with the archaic meaning of queer: a movement aslant, sideways. Sexuality is indeed on the move&#x2014;not just because people are more on the move now than ever, but because non-normative sexualities so generally seem out of place and are so often enabled by the displacements of culture. This will be an extremely useful book not only for queer theory, but for anyone interested in the trajectories of identity and sexual culture in the contemporary world.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Warner, Rutgers University <p>&#x201c;Queer Diasporas is one of the first books to bring together the concerns of American queer studies with perspectives generated by cross-national, culturally comparative scholarship.

Reprint.</p><p>John Pellam, scouting locations for a new film in a small town in Missouri, inadvertently witnesses a double homicide and some serious gunplay that left a cop paralyzed. He didn't see the guy who ordered the killings, but the police don't believe him. The U.S. attorney who thinks he knows who was behind the murders has bet his career on Pellam's identification of a criminal the feds have been trying to nail for years. They'll do anything to get Pellam's cooperation, including threatening his new girlfriend, shutting down the movie, and keeping Pellam from inking a deal to get his own film made. That project is Pellam's ticket back to the top of the heap in Hollywood, a perch he fell off of when he supplied the drugs that killed his best friend. The cops want Pellam's testimony, the mob boss wants him permanently silenced, and the film's director wants him to finish the job he's been paid to do. But first Pellam has to find his way out of the traps they've all set for him, and he does it with style, wit, and a self-deprecating charm that makes him a hero to everyone--well, almost everyone.<p> William Jefferies, who usually writes under the better-known nom de plume of Jeffery Deaver, has a couple of other Location Scout mysteries to his name (<i>Shallow Graves</i>, <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>).

The youngest of eleven children, Brendan O&#x2019;Carroll was born in Dublin&#x2019;s inner-city in 1955. His mother, Maureen, was a Labour TD (MP) and a huge influence on his life. He left school at 12 and worked as a waiter, trying many other occupations in his spare time - disco manager, milkman, pirate radio disc-jockey, painter-decorator etc. For a time he ran his own bar and cabaret lounge before being persuaded to try the comedy circuit. The gigs were small at first and even included his own version of &#x2018;Blind Date&#x2019;, but word soon got around about this original and outrageous funnyman: soon there was standing-room only. The real turning point in Brendan&#x2019;s career was his first appearance on The Late Late Show, Ireland&#x2019;s longest-running chat show: the studio audience and viewers loved him. His first video Live at the Tivoli went straight to No 1, knocking U2 out of the top slot and pushing Garth Brooks to No 3. In 1994 he was voted Ireland&#x2019;s No 1 Variety Entertainer at the National Entertainment Awards. He went on to make best-selling videos, and a bestselling record, as well as touring in Ireland, the UK and the USA. The radio show Mrs Browne&#x2019;s Boys, written by and starring Brendan, had a phenomenal daily audience on 2FM and led to the creation of Agnes Browne as the central character in Brendan&#x2019;s first novel, The Mammy, published in 1994. The book topped the bestseller charts in Ireland for months and the film rights were snapped up. The Mammy was followed by The Chisellers and The Granny: all three were huge bestsellers. Holywood came calling when Anjelica Huston read and loved Brendan's books: she made her directorial debut with Agnes Browne. Brendan toured several other stage shows with Agnes Browne as the central character, before a BBC producer saw the show and felt there was television potential. Initially broadcast in a quiet late evening slot, Mrs Brown's Boys quickly became a huge word-of-mouth hit, and quickly moved to primetime, including several Christmas Day specials. A huge success in Australia and other countries where it has been shown, the enduring appeal of Agnes and her family is secure. Brendan continues to write and perform as Agnes Browne, most recently in Mrs Brown's Boys: d'Movie (2014)... another fine piece of work by one of this country&#39;s finest entertainers ...the story is great ... you&#39;ll enjoy this read -- Evening Echo &#39;something of a classic tale in the modern mode&#39; -- Books Ireland When are we going to be able to buy shares in this man? -- Evening Herald Fans of Brendan O&#39;Carroll will welcome this latest excursion into his territory of Dublin&#39;s back streets...after many hilarious adventures Sparrow emerges a wiser and better man. -- Leinster Leader A simple but pacey cops and robbers story with a fair sprinkling of the kind of humorous flourishes one would expect from O&#39;Carroll....an enjoyable read -- Tuam Herald A great story and ample evidence of Brendan O&#39;Carroll&#39;s skill as an entertainer and raconteur -- The Examiner Admirers of the moustached comedian&#39;s previous books...will need little prompting to buy the new one.

During these years he also travelled extensively and converted to Catholicism. In 1939 Waugh was commissioned in the Royal Marines and later transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, experiences which informed his Sword of Honour trilogy (1952-61). His most famous novel, Brideshead Revisited (1945), was written while on leave from the army.

(<i>Style Weekly</i>)<br><br>the author captures the spirit of exploration and adventure in Spanish treasures both lost and found on the high seas. (<i>Sport Diver Magazine</i>)<br><br>Based on the exceptional and fascinating eyewitness account of a 17th century Spanish padre, Dave Horner's Shipwreck is the absorbing and true story of two immense galleons that were lost (along with hundreds of passengers and millions of pesos in treasure) to disasters at sea. Shipwreck is an extraordinary literary adventure which interweaves accounts of the many attempts throughout the past three centuries to recover the sunken treasure, including the recent discovery and salvage of one of the galleons by Dave Horner himself. Shipwreck is an outstanding history of true adventure on the high seas, past and present, which is wonderfully enhanced for the reader with 50 halftone photographic illustrations, six maps, four line drawings, seven appendices, as well as bibliographies of archival sources, institutions, original documents or primary works, and a general listing of thematically appropriate titles for further suggested readings. (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>Some people dream of buried treasure. Some read about it with fascination. A rare few take a deep breath and jump in after it. Dave Horner does all three. <br>Reading this book, you understand that Horner isn't just some wild-eyes adventurer. You also understand that, in being a scholar and writer as well as a treasure seeker, Horner swerves from the centuries-old salvor tradition of dive, pillage, and disappear. <br>Horner's book, Shipwreck, tells many tales. First, there are blow-by-blow accounts of the wrecks of two Spanish galleons: La Capitana, carrying 10 million pesos in silver coin and bullion, grounded on the reefs off the coast of Ecuador in 1654; and Maravillas, a 900-ton ocean liner, four stories tall, strewn across the white sand under the waters of the Little Bahama Bank in 1656. A sailor himself, Horner loves to melodramatize a maritime mishap, as when "The rigging clattered, the wind howled and shrieked like all the devils of hell." <br>Standing steady through the storms is Padre Diego Portichuelo, a priest with a wild hair up you-know-where that drove him into the company of pirates and thieves. In 1657 he published a diary of the escapades he witnessed, and his half-pious voice surfaces now and then as Horner uses him to tell the tales first-person. The padre can get colorful, as when he describes pigs brought aboard, hog-tied and huddled into a galleon corner, their constant grunting shushed when a Honduran seaman "cut six-inch pieces of papaya wood and rammed the sticks well into the rectum of each swine," at which point "the only noise the pigs emitted was an occasional whistle when wind was passed through the papaya twigs." You've got to believe that Horner embellished just a bit on the good padre's diary. <br>The third level of story links salvors of the ages with Horner's own salvage operations, performed with significant success off the Honduran coast in 1997. To read the lists of 17th-century divers and their hauls, it's a wonder there's any treasure left in the Caribbean sands.

In 1986, Austrian Reinhold Messner became the first person to scale all of them without the use of supplemental oxygen. Viesturs is currently on a quest to become the first American to reproduce this astonishing feat. This book presents photographs from his expeditions on the 12 tallest mountains in the world. A world-class climber, Viesturs is blessed with an "unusual physiology"; his body's ability to process oxygen extraordinarily well allows him to remain unusually alert and vigorous even at oxygen-scarce altitudes. That clarity of mind is amply demonstrated in these stunning photographs. Viesturs emphasizes the difficulty of taking pictures at such heights and even charmingly includes imperfect shots (from a technical perspective) that have special meaning to him. Standout images include the vast, ridged, snowy valley framed by Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse; the "maze of crevasses" of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm; and the carpet of clouds draped across the several peaks of Makalu, Lhotse, Everest and Cho Oyu taken from the vantage point of Kanchenjunga. Replete with helpful maps, this book almost doubles as a travel guide; the lack of hotels doesn't make it any less informative for the tiny number of people eager to see these staggering vistas for themselves.

The Finnerans -- parents and five children, Irish Catholics in St. Louis -- are a seemingly unexceptional family. Theirs is a story seldom told, yet it makes manifest how rich and truly extraordinary the ordinary daily experience we take for granted is. In quietly luminous language, Kathleen Finneran renders the emotional, spiritual, and physical terrain of family life -- its closeness and disconnection, its intimacy and estrangement--and pays tribute to the love between parents and children, brothers and sisters.<br> Ultimately, it is this love that sustains the Finnerans, for at the heart of THE TENDER LAND lies a catastrophic event: the suicide at fifteen of the author's younger brother after a public humiliation in junior high school. A gentle, handsome boy, Sean was a straight-A student and gifted athlete, especially treasured by every member of his family. Masterfully, the book interweaves past and present, showing how inseparable they are, and how the long accumulation of love and memory helps the Finnerans survive their terrible loss.<br> THE TENDER LAND is a testament to the always complicated ways in which we love one another. In the end, the Finnerans are a family much like the reader's own: like every other family, like no other family.</p><p>This sensitive, restrained memoir searches for answers to the most painful of questions: Why would a bright, athletic, seemingly well-adjusted boy like Kathleen Finneran's 15-year-old brother want to take his own life? Sean Finneran's 1971 suicide is the pivotal crisis in <i>The Tender Land</i>, but not the only one. References to a family strain of depressive mental illness sound a warning note; Finneran's maternal grandfather probably killed himself, and her mother is subject to severe bouts of depression that may also have afflicted Sean, whose suicide note reveals a self-hatred that the love of his parents and siblings could not assuage. The author frankly relates her own problems with weight, an inexplicable but irresistible urge to shoplift, and uncertain sexual orientation. But Finneran's precise prose, rich in evocative physical details, convincingly limns an ordinary, generally happy Midwestern family: five children spread over 16 years; a devout, nature- and animal-loving mother; a father who communicated best without words, rooted in "his faith in materials men make of the earth." There are no villains and no answers in this heartbreaking book, which respects the essential mystery of a shattering tragedy and closes with an affirmative message to Sean: "I want to call out your name and tell you, across the tender land, that we have gone on living." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>KATHLEEN FINNERAN was born in St. Louis and is a graduate of Washington University.

Kate and her late husband Benjy vacationed there, in a house they built themselves. Now, according to Nora, someone is out to decimate the tiny population. Two men, both ardent protectors of the island's pristine state, have died; a young woman visitor has disappeared; and Phil is in the hospital after a heart attack caused by someone aware of his phobic fear of snakes. Death and mayhem follow Kate's arrival as she struggles to find the driving force behind it all, aided by wily old-timer Ash, who sees all and says little. He's a sturdy support when she homes in on the fairly obvious villain and flies a plane, for the first time, to save the latest victim. Much coming and going in cars, boats, and planes; endless talk of dogs, cats, and more exotic animal life; mostly dull and chirpy characters--all make for a fussy, only mildly engrossing story. Add a plus for nature lovers. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Intelligent, plucky widower Kate Mulcay (last seen in Ah, Sweet Mystery ) carries this murder mystery, the resolution of which will be apparent even to novice armchair sleuths. Atlantan Kate is called to Ila Island off the Florida coast, where she has a vacation home, by her friend and year-round resident, Nora Noble. Suspecting that island residents are being killed, Nora asks Kate, who is a reporter, to investigate. Before Kate can get there, Nora's husband, Phil, who is afraid of snakes, suffers a non-fatal heart attack when he finds a rattler in the living room. Soon Kate is attacked by a wildcat in her cabin. Then Phil suffers another heart attack (fatal this time) when he sees a snake in the cockpit of his island-hopping plane. Kate becomes convinced that Nora's isn't just an hysterical reaction and that a killer is loose on the island. Attentive descriptions of the tiny island and its inhabitants enliven a predictable story. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Long March: The Choctaw&#39;s Gift to Irish Famine Relief</h2><p>"This deeply moving work quietly and effectively underscores the drama and pathos of a little-known historical episode.

She lives in Dublin, Ireland.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Gr. 4^-7. Part history, part parable, this moving picture book tells the true story of how the impoverished Choctaw Indians sent relief to help the Irish during the potato famine in 1847. At first the boy Choona, 14, is furious (the Europeans "have come to our land and taken it from us . . . Why should we help them?"). Then his great-grandmother, Talihoyo, describes the horror of the Choctaws' Long March. Quietly she tells how the Choctaws were forced to leave their homeland in Mississippi and walk 500 miles west in the freezing winter. Half the people died ("All the old ones. All the small children. Gone"). Fitzpatrick's strong, detailed pencil illustrations are as direct and beautiful as the words, capturing the sweeping landscape and the individual portraits of Choctaw people across generations. Most moving is the double-page spread showing the Long March, with tiny individual figures bent and struggling through the endless snow. Choona listens and feels the bond between his own people's displacement and the Irish desperation. Irish author-illustrator Fitzpatrick, who worked with Choctaw editor Gary WhiteDeer, tells the history through the fictional voice of an old man remembering. The message is in the connections. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The United States and the Global Struggle for Minerals</h2><p><p>In 1973&#x2013;1974 soaring commodity prices and an oil embargo alerted Americans to the twin dangers of resource exhaustion and dependence on unreliable foreign materials suppliers.

At that time, religious doctrine and common sense dictated that the earth ruled the universe, with the sun, moon, planets, and stars all rotating around it. By putting the sun at the center of that cosmology, his book fomented another kind of revolution&#x2014;a scientific one&#x2014;that would lead to a completely new view of the universe, and humanity's place in it.<br><br>As contemporary cosmologists explore the universe's vastness and the nearly insignificant role we play in it, the repercussions from Copernicus's radical step continue to resound. With the energetic prose and powerful intelligence for which he is known, William T.

Fortunately, they don't have to, as Vollmann, whose <i>Europe Central</i> won this year's National Book Award for fiction, provides a highly personal and philosophical gloss of all six chapters of Copernicus's <i>De revolutionibus</i> (1543). Vollmann interrupts his exegeses with discussions of the contemporary mindset, the limits of observation at the time (we're told repeatedly how difficult it is to spot Mercury without a good pair of binoculars) and the scientist's quiet, provincial career. What seems most remarkable about Copernicus's book after reading Vollmann's version is how firmly his work is based on Ptolemy's. It's also striking how close he came to modern astronomical values, especially since he thought that arriving within 10 degrees of a true value would be an amazing achievement. Vollmann can't completely avoid technical explanations, but readers who want to understand the significance of Copernicus's book in both his own time and ours will find this the next best thing to reading it. 20 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Feb. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the Caldecott Medal-winning author-illustrator of The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses.</p><p><b>Paul Goble</b>&nbsp;has received wide acclaim for his magnificent books, including&nbsp;<i>Buffalo Woman, Dream Wolf, Her Seven Brothers,</i>&nbsp;and the winner of the 1979 Caldecott Medal,&nbsp;<i>The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses.</i>&nbsp;Commenting on his work in&nbsp;<i>Beyond the Ridge,</i>&nbsp;<i>Horn Book Magazine</i>&nbsp;said, "striking elements synthesize the graphics with the narrative and spiritual aspects of the text." The&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;noted that his technique is "a marriage of authentic design and contemporary artistry, and it succeeds beautifully." Paul Goble's most recent book for Bradbury Press,&nbsp;<i>I Sing for the Animals,</i>&nbsp;was called "a lovely, small book that movingly conveys profound belief in the goodness of creation" by&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>School Library Journal</i>&nbsp;said it "fits as easily in the hand as Goble's meditations about the natural world do in the heart."Based on a sacred myth of the Blackfoot Indians, this handsome picture book tells of six brothers sadly neglected by their contemporaries. Orphaned at an early age, clothed in rags and heaped with scorn, the boys "did not wish to be people any longer." They decided to become stars ("we will always be beautiful") and rose into the night sky to be with Father Sun and Mother Moon--myth has it that they were transformed into the Pleiades. Goble tells this story with earnest simplicity, a gentle cadence to his words imbuing the text with particular significance. His illustrations--dazzling in color, crisp and clean in design--prove typically arresting. Especially noteworthy are his scrupulously depicted tipis; an addendum explains the meaning of their symbols. Cars painted alongside the tipis in the final scene add a potent contemporary touch. Tied in with the message here--the importance of love for others--is a timely, subtle allusion to the plight of the homeless: "They slept and ate in one place today, and another tomorrow, and they were always hungry. Their only clothes were what people had discarded." All ages. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Narrative Research in Ministry: A Postmodern Research Approach for Faith Communities</h2><p>We are in a real sense, our stories. Who we are, what we think, and how we act are all shaped by the many large and small stories that make up the discourse embedded in our multi-sensory social experience. It is this postmodern understanding of identity and reality that has prompted the authors to fashion a new way of thinking about doing research in faith communities today, particularly through a Doctor of Ministry program. It is our belief that, in order for faith communities to define themselves and to know what to do in ministry, they must first understand the multiple stories which intersect with a given ministry situation in their specific context.</p><p></p><h2>Victory: The Triumphant Gay Revolution (Olive Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>In the vein of Taylor Branch&#x2019;s classic <em>Parting of the Waters, </em>Supreme Court lawyer and political pundit<em> </em>Linda Hirshman delivers the enthralling, groundbreaking story of the gay rights movement, revealing how a dedicated and resourceful minority changed America forever&#x2014;now available in a limited Olive Edition.</strong></p><p>When the modern struggle for gay rights erupted in the summer of 1969, forty-nine states outlawed sex between people of the same gender.

His life, in the hands of Frederic Raphael, becomes a point of departure for an appraisal of Diasporan Jews seeking a place in the dominant cultures they inhabit. Raphael brings a scholar&#x2019;s rigor, a historian&#x2019;s perspective, and a novelist&#x2019;s imagination to this project. He goes beyond the fascinating details of Josephus&#x2019;s life and his singular literary achievements to examine how Josephus has been viewed by posterity, finding in him the prototype for the un-Jewish Jew, the assimilated intellectual, and the abiding apostate: the recurrent figures in the long centuries of the Diaspora. Raphael&#x2019;s insightful portraits of Yehuda Halevi, Baruch Spinoza, Karl Kraus, Benjamin Disraeli, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Hannah Arendt extend and illuminate the Josephean worldview Raphael so eloquently lays out.</p></p><p><p><b>Frederic Raphael</b> is the author of more than twenty novels, f ive volumes of short stories, biographies of Byron and W. Somerset Maugham, and five volumes of his personal notebooks and journals. He is also the translator of, among other works, Petronius&#x2019;s <i>Satyrica</i> and is a regular contributor to the <i>Times Literary Supplement.</i></p>I<br><br>Observed across the abyss of years, the rebellion in which Joseph ben Mattathias was to play a leading part appears like a remake of the story of David and Goliath. Despite the fact that, this time, Goli- ath won, the Jews&#x2019; defiant last stand, in 73 c.e., while defending the gaunt mountaintop fortress of Masada, in the southern desert, has been used, especially in modern Israel, to illustrate how the flower of the Jewish nation, having risen en bloc against imperial oppression, resisted to the last man. For some Zionists at least, the lesson of &#x201c;the Jewish War&#x201d; is that the only people Jews can trust are other Jews. The long story that Flavius Josephus lived to tell is less romantic and more complicated.<br><br>Ever since Alexander the Great conquered and appropriated the Persian Empire, only to have it break up into fractious kingdoms after his early death in 323 b.c.e., the Fertile Crescent had been a patchwork of fiefdoms, religions and antagonisms. Lacking gorgeous and impassable rivers or a bulwark of mountains, Judaea was regularly at the mercy of armies, which marched through it or chose to garrison its cities. Two of Alexander&#x2019;s Macedonian marshals, Seleucus and Ptolemy, founded Middle Eastern empires. Their royal successors&#x2014;Seleucids in Syria, Ptolemies in Egypt&#x2014;played tug-of-war with Palestine for almost two centuries.<br><br>The Romans were only the last, the best disciplined and the most tenacious of the foreign invaders. As Josephus recalls in Jewish Antiquities, Rome&#x2019;s intrusion into Judaea was the result of an unwise invitation from contending Jewish factions: in 63 b.c.e., Pompey the Great, who was playing for bigger stakes in nearby Syria, was called in as arbiter during a fraternal feud between Aristobulus (the last king of the Maccabean dynasty) and his ineffectual brother Hyrcanus, the High Priest. The latter served as a front for a rich, nominally Hellenized Idumaean called Antipater, who coveted the throne for himself.<br><br>Pompey had also been petitioned by a third group of Jews: the pious Zealots, who craved a return to a hermetic life that acknowledged no secular authority. Ultra-Orthodox, often lower-class, they advocated a purified theocracy, free of alien corruption and, of course, under their own leadership. It was their regular charge against the High Priest and his council, the Sanhedrin, that they habitually faced both (or several) ways. Zealots were vehement in accusing the hierarchy of being willing to trade Jewish independence in order to maintain their own standing. This did not inhibit fundamentalists from seeking to recruit Pompey to their cause.<br><br>The three Jewish parties had in common only the na�ve presumption that the Romans would come in, cancel their enemies and then leave. In the event, Pompey did not give priority to a profitless squabble between native pretenders. First he completed the annexation of the Seleucid Empire to the greater glory of the Senate and the Roman people, and to his own and his soldiers&#x2019; financial advantage. Only after Aristobulus dared to anticipate his judgment, by raising an army of his own, did the Roman grandee march on Jerusalem.<br><br>The supporters of Hyrcanus opened the gates. Aristobulus and his men barricaded themselves in the Temple precinct. Neither then nor in Josephus&#x2019;s day did the city&#x2019;s Jews react with solidarity to external force. After a three-month siege, there was a massacre in which, Josephus says, twelve thousand Jews died, including those unresisting priests engaged in the exercise of their office.1 Josephus adds a bitter detail: &#x201c;Most who fell were killed by their own countrymen of the rival faction; others beyond number threw themselves over the precipices.&#x201d;<br><br>Pompey became the first Roman to stride into the curtained inner sanctum of the Temple. Perhaps in superstitious awe of its numinous vacancy, he touched nothing. Just over a century later, the curtain would be only a small part of the booty Titus took to Rome to swag his father&#x2019;s triumph. The survivors among the priesthood, either because of their dignity or by virtue of the revenue at their disposal, had a chastening effect on Pompey. Inclined to fastidious gestures (malicious contemporaries accused him of being effeminate because he would scratch his head with one finger, in order not to distress his coiffure, which was set to resemble that of Alexander the Great), Pompey consented to the Temple being cleansed of blood and then licensed the resumption of the rites. He was remembered by the Jews more for his sacrilege than for his belated courtesy. Two centuries later, a gang of Jews desecrated the Egyptian tomb containing his headless corpse.<br><br>In 61 b.c.e., the evicted Aristobulus and his family, having been shipped to Rome, were obliged to walk in front of Pompey&#x2019;s triumphal chariot; but they were spared the customary chains. A large contingent of Jews was also paraded in the ritual of the triumph. Such occasions had the allure of a mobile circus, complete with &#x201c;floats&#x201d; representing scenes from the victorious campaign.2 The festivities usually ended with the execution of defeated leaders, but the Judaeans appear to have been released when the metropolitan circuit was complete. A number remained to swell the Jewish community in Rome. It grew to forty thousand in imperial times.<br><br>Two years after Pompey&#x2019;s parade, there were enough Jews resident in the capital for Cicero to complain&#x2014;while defending Lucius Valerius Flaccus, an ex-governor of Asia&#x2014;that Roman justice was under threat from a loud swarm of Jews. Since Roman trials were often conducted in the open air, star advocates attracted large, sometimes rowdy, crowds of spectators. Cicero was used to generating sympathy by affecting to fight against intimidating odds. Flaccus had been accused of siphoning off tribute, sent by Jews from all over the Mediterranean, while it was on its way to the Temple in Jerusalem. Adept at playing to the gallery, Cicero had recourse to whatever means would lead to his client&#x2019;s acquittal. He did nothing to challenge the truth of the charges against Flaccus, but claimed that Pompey&#x2019;s recent &#x201c;victory&#x201d; in Jerusalem proved that the gods had deserted the Jews, since they would otherwise have defeated him.<br><br>To infer that Rome&#x2019;s &#x201c;Jewish lobby&#x201d; acted in an unusual or improper fashion is to take Ciceronian bluster for reliable evidence. Roman advocacy was a public performance that has been likened to bel canto: it sanctioned whatever bravura flights might impress a jury or amuse the gallery. Rome&#x2019;s Jews are unlikely to have made Cicero as nervous as it served his case to pretend. Cicero&#x2019;s older colleague and fellow litt�rateur, Marcus Terentius Varro, with no case to argue, acclaimed Judaism as a true religio. He rated it above the superstitious cults, with their fetishistic statuary, that flourished in the Rome of his day.<br><br>In 48 b.c.e., the civil war between Caesar and Pompey ended with Pompey&#x2019;s decisive defeat at Pharsalus, in northern Greece. He fled to Egypt. When Caesar followed, one of the Ptolemies presented him, on landing, with the embalmed head of his late enemy and onetime son-in-law. Caesar had the grace to seem rueful, but the Egyptian queen Cleopatra&#x2019;s alluring proximity made him casual about security. Boxed in at Alexandria by a large force of hostile &#x201c;Egyptians,&#x201d; Caesar was rescued, in extremis, by the cavalry of Antipater, the Idumaean chieftain, and his ally Hyrcanus II, whose military skills, on this occasion, matched his priestly eminence. Hyrcanus was rewarded with the eth- narchy of the Jews. Antipater&#x2019;s sons, Phasael and Herod, then twenty-five years old, were named governors of Jerusalem and Galilee, respectively. Neither was fully a Jew; their mother, Kypros, was a &#x201c;distinguished lady from Arabia.&#x201d;<br><br>If his generosity was its measure, Caesar had had a serious fright. It led him to sanction Jews all around the Mediterranean to resume the dispatch of tribute to Jerusalem, thus strengthening the city&#x2019;s economy, since the Temple treasury functioned as a central bank. Caesar also excused Jews from conscription. In Josephus&#x2019;s view, the settlement gave the Judaeans every privilege short of independence. It was the high point of their relations with the Romans. Only the fundamentalist Zealots, vigilant for righteous grievances (and for excuses to impose their version of rectitude on others), could object to so amiable an arrangement. Caesar&#x2019;s indulgence was typical of Roman methods when recruiting provincials as allies. His exemption of Jews from military service was both a grace and an acknowledgment that, as recruits, they could be more trouble than they were worth: they would not eat the same food as the other soldiers; however brave they might be on weekdays, many refused to fight on the Sabbath.<br><br>As long as Caesar was busy imposing his autocracy on the rump of Pompey&#x2019;s supporters, Judaea made no urgent call on Roman attention. Seen from the Seven Hills, it was the pacified adjunct of a province under the mandate of the governor of Syria. For those who lived there, however, there was no shortage of bloody incident. Palestine was home to endless feuds, tribal antagonism and coups d&#x2019;�tat. Local events frequently reflected what was happening at the center. In 44 b.c.e., the deified Julius Caesar was stabbed to death in Rome, under Pompey&#x2019;s statue. In 43 b.c.e., his prot�g� Antipater was poisoned in Judea. The killer is likely to have been one of the bounty hunters who could expect rewards for murdering the enemy of any dominant faction. Since Antipater had been Caesar&#x2019;s man, his assassin could hope for profitable congratulations from the great man&#x2019;s murderers.<br><br>Rome had divided into two parties. &#x201c;The Liberators,&#x201d; led by Brutus and Cassius, were confronted by Mark Antony and, very soon, by Caesar&#x2019;s heir and adopted son, the nineteen-year-old Octavian. &#x201c;That young man,&#x201d; as Cicero termed him, had no right to power (according to the traditional rules, he was not even old enough to run for petty office), but he could call on the fidelity of Caesar&#x2019;s veterans, who had good reason to hope for handouts in land and bonuses. The less constitutional the cause, the fatter the potential dividends: why else were Rubicons crossed?<br><br>In Book I of The Jewish War, Josephus concentrates on the consequences in Judaea of Caesar&#x2019;s assassination: Phasael and Herod&#x2014;as conspicuous for his passions as for his panache&#x2014;made a bid for control of Judaea. In 40 b.c.e., Rome&#x2019;s most reliable general, Mark Antony assumed command of forces in the region; but then, falling under the same spell as his dead patron, he deferred military duties in order to follow the now thirty-year-old Cleopatra to Alexandria. Alert to the divisions and distractions of the Romans, the Parthians&#x2014;on the eastern flank of the imperial frontier&#x2014;marched into Syria and on to Jerusalem. Their occupation of the Temple gave Herod and his brother an opportunity to promote themselves as patriotic heroes; but when they attempted to depose the Parthians&#x2019; puppet, King Antigonus (the last of the Maccabean line), they had no success. Tricked into a parley, Phasael and his father&#x2019;s ally, Hyrcanus, were made prisoners.<br><br>Herod managed to slip away to Masada, not far from where he would later build himself a grandiose compound. Complete with a closet theater, decorated with Greco-Roman images, its ruins stand proof of his pagan tastes. The mountaintop fortress was reinforced by Herod, once he attained power, principally as a means of asserting himself over the Jews who, he feared, rightly, never regarded him as their legitimate king. Herod&#x2019;s plethora of castles, armories and fortified palaces is evidence both of the ruler&#x2019;s distrust of his subjects and of his fear of possible rivals.<br><br>While in Parthian custody, Herod&#x2019;s brother, Phasael, committed suicide by smashing his head against a rock. Hyrcanus&#x2019;s ears were cut off, so that he could no longer be eligible to hold the office of High Priest (its tenant had to be without physical blemish, of which stammering was not an instance). Herod rallied to Mark Antony. Amorous and amoral adventurers, the two men had compatible tastes and ambitions. Having left Cleopatra, temporarily, in order to return to Rome, Antony put himself forward as Caesar&#x2019;s successor as top man. Herod wanted to be boss only of the Fertile Crescent. Licensed to return to Judaea, he evicted Antigonus, with the aid of Roman troops, and installed himself as Antony&#x2019;s client king.<br><br>Since he had to pay his mercenary army fat bonuses, Herod imitated the practice of murderous proscriptions initiated in Rome by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 82 b.c.e. when, in revenge for its failure to support his right-wing coup d&#x2019;�tat, he decimated the senatorial class and distributed their estates to his confederates. Antigonus&#x2019;s friends and family were killed and their property confiscated. At home and abroad, theft was as good a motive for murder as enmity. No one has ever needed to dislike a man in order to covet his wealth or his office. To reconcile the urban masses to his rule, Herod eased their chronic unemployment by initiating large public works; as well as renovating the Temple, he had the streets of Jerusalem paved with flagstones. The people were glad to take his wages, but he failed to win their hearts.<br><br>Herod knew how to make himself feared, but he never allayed his own dread of treachery. Apprehensive of its independence and authority, he further degraded the venerated office of High Priest by installing an unknown Babylonian returnee, Ananelus, in the post. Said to be descended from the original Zadok, Ananelus&#x2019;s best qualification, in Herod&#x2019;s eyes, was that he had no nexus of support in Jerusalem; he was, in effect, the king&#x2019;s Jew. Not long afterward, however, in order to please his future wife Mariamne, Herod replaced Ananelus with her sixteen-year-old brother, another Aristobulus. When the young man officiated at the Feast of Tabernacles, his handsome appearance and Maccabean lineage made such a popular impression that Herod feared an uprising in his favor. One very hot day, the guileless Aristobulus was taken, by a party of Herod&#x2019;s acolytes, to have a swim in a pool near Jericho. They held him under the water until he drowned.<br><br>Herod was happier in the cosmopolitan society of the Hellenistic Levant than among Jews. He could not resist the high-stakes game of Roman power politics. As Mark Antony and Octavian turned on each other, Herod decided to go and see Antony in order to confirm their amicitia (the Latin term for &#x201c;friendship&#x201d; implied political alliance rather more than personal affection). Josephus records how Herod left Mariamne, the love of his life, in the custody of Joseph, the husband of his sister, Salome, with instructions that, should Herod himself be arrested and executed by Antony, his brother-in-law was to kill Mariamne rather than let her marry anyone else.3<br><br>Having renewed his deal with Antony, Herod returned to Judaea to find that his instructions to Joseph had been leaked to Mariamne by Herod&#x2019;s mother and his sister, Salome; both hoped to make trouble between the couple. Mariamne&#x2019;s origins were suspect: she was descended, on both sides, from the Hasmonaeans, the royal house that had sprung from the now severely pruned family tree of the Maccabees. Herod had eliminated the Maccabean males, but his love for Mariamne excused her from his habitual ruthlessness. As soon as he was making love to her again, the king swore that she was the only woman he had ever loved. &#x201c;And a nice way you show it,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;giving Joseph orders to kill me!&#x201d; Persuaded that she had always hated him and that she had committed adultery with his brother-in-law, Herod flew into a frenzy and had her strangled.<br><br>Once Mariamne was dead, the king was consumed by regret. He spent hours in anguished conversation with her spi...</p><h2>Piercing the Fog of War: Recognizing Change on the Battlefield: Lessons from Military History, 216 BC Through Today</h2><p><p>If its true that generals tend to fight the last war, how do we meet the military challenge of the new? It is this question, which confronts us at every turn of history, that Brian Steed takes up in <i>Piercing the Fog of War</i><b>.</b> From the ancient surprises of Cannae and Yarmouk to the earthshaking upsets of Trenton and Little Big Horn to the recent shocks of Gozny and suicide terrorists, aberrational events are mileposts that mark changes in the paradigm of armed conflict to the detriment of the apparently stronger military through the ages. Drawing upon twenty years of studying, teaching, and applying military history, Steed develops an understanding of how the nature of conflict in all its aspects--from the economic to the military--is changing so rapidly and presenting its proponents with so many unique, and uniquely demanding, events. Through eight case studies from the classical to the modern era he explores strategies for successfully addressing unexpected circumstances in a changing world. His book will become a primer for conflict resolution and adaptation in an ever more uncertain world . . . and a necessary text for survival.</p></p><p><p>From the ancient surprises of Cannae and Yarmouk to the earthshaking upsets of Trenton and Little Big Horn to the recent shocks of Gozny and suicide terrorists, aberrational events are mileposts that mark changes in the paradigm of armed conflict to the detriment of the apparently stronger military through the ages.&nbsp; This book develops an understanding of how the nature of conflict in all its aspects--from the economic to the military--is changing so rapidly and presenting its proponents with so many unique, and uniquely demanding, events.&nbsp; Through eight case studies from the classical to the modern era it explores strategies for successfully addressing unexpected circumstances in a changing world.</p><p>This book is about extreme, unexpected change in war, the phenomenon that author Brian L. Steed calls <i>aberration</i>. Aberration is not mere surprise, not just the unexpected; it is something that is so far outside our normal frame of reference as to be unrecognizable. In the heat of the moment, an aberration may just cause embarrassment or financial loss; in the heat of battle, aberration will cause death and defeat.<b><i> </i></b><i>Piercing the Fog of War</i> is a study of aberration in war.</p> <p>Author Steed&#x2019;s study of seven &#x201c;aberrational&#x201d; battles drawn from the full timeline of military history shows how unrecognized change can have a profound effect upon victory and defeat. These case studies include both ancient battles, such as Cannae in 216 BC, as well as more contemporary combat, such as the Battle of Grozny (Chechnya) that started on New Year&#x2019;s Eve 1994. Steed includes both famous battles, such as Little Big Horn, as well as others, such as the Horns of Hattin, that are lesser known.</p> <p>Each case study presents a detailed and uniform consideration of the subject battle, including geographical setting, units involved, key leaders, historical and grand strategy, tactical chronology, battlefield leadership, and lessons learned. In the discussion of each battle, the author applies the &#x201c;strategies&#x201d; he has developed to provide the reader a framework for analysis of battle. From introspection to &#x201c;think science fiction,&#x201d; these strategies allow combat leaders to recognize the difference between unexpected and never before known or experienced, between surprise and aberration.</p> <p>Expect the unexpected. Think outside the box. But can you . . . really? In any conflict, if the commander fails to recognize an aberrational event, defeat will be the result. <i>Piercing the Fog of War</i> provides all leaders a means of expanding the box in order to better deal with true aberration.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Major Brian L.

"A true telling and a healing fiction, clearly inspired by the Great Lady herself. The power of her presence permeates each page."--Jean Houston, author of <b>The Possible Human.</b></p><p>"A dazzling work of historical imagination. With her rich knowledge of liturgical music, steeped in the subtle rhythms of the church year, Barbara Lachman has a deep understanding of the monastic life as Hildegard lived it. In lyrical, uncannily authentic prose, she conveys the intrepid seer's earthy pragmatism as well as her soaring Godward elan and her shrewd observations of the world around her."<p>Barbara Newman, author of Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of tile Feminine</p><p></p>Not, as the title suggests, the actual journal of Hildegard (1098-1179), the best-known female Catholic mystic of the early Middle Ages, but rather a fictional tour-de-force by debut writer Lachman. Hildegard's immense output included books of visions, natural histories, herbal cures, and poetry, as well as innovative chants and mandala-like paintings of cosmic Christian scenes. But she never wrote a journal. Lachman gives us the next best thing--a mocked-up version that captures the flavor of Hildegard and her extraordinary times. The entries cover a bit more than a year, from December 11, 1157, to January 6, 1153; during this 13-month stretch, Hildegard struggles to establish her own monastery, designs a cloister church, weaves a Lenten cloth, mothers a brood of nuns, and heals the sick, all the while performing the many daily offices required of Benedictine nuns through the liturgical year. Subsidiary characters come and go--Volmar, priest and confidant; Rikkarda, a rebellious nun--but the focus is always on Hildegard, above all on her feverish interior life, aflame with visions, premonitions, and symbolic dreams that she attempts to decipher without benefit of Freud. Lest the reader be swamped by 12th-century monastic arcana, Lachman provides a glossary as well as splendidly copious notes (indelicately crammed alongside--not underneath, as is customary--the main text on each page, making the book sometimes hard to read). Trivial as story--nothing much happens, and dramatic tension is nil--but altogether a more accurate portrait of the medieval mind than, say, The Name of the Rose. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A fine and powerful novel...stark in its drama, steamy in its setting, acidic in its irony, relentless in its narrative thrust. &#x2015;Alan Ryan, Washington Post</p><p>Trozas, here translated into English for the first time, completes the set of B. Traven&#39;s legendary Jungle Novels. Describing the conditions of peonage and debt slavery suffered by Mexican Indians during the reign of Porfirio Diaz, they form an epic of the birth of the Mexican Revolution. The main character of Trozas is a young Indian named Andres Ugaldo, a virtual slave worker in a monteria - mahogany plantation - which is purchased by the profit-hungry Montellano brothers, widely despised for their brutal treatment of workers. The demands on Andres and his companions exceed even the usual insufferable conditions in the monteria. Trozas (the word means &#34;logs&#34;) captures the origins of the rebellious spirit that slowly spread through the labor camps and haciendas of Mexico, culminating in the bloody revolt that ended Diaz&#39;s rule. In the hands of a masterful storyteller like B. Traven, the portrait of Andres and his political awakening makes arresting reading. Traven evokes the backbreaking daily routine of the monteria, brings alive the players in this sordid drama, and confirms his stature as one of the narrative masters of the twentieth century.The mysterious B. Traven (1890&#x2013;1969) was born in Chicago, spent his youth in Germany as an itinerant actor and revolutionary journalist, became a seaman on tramp steamers, settled in Mexico in the early 1920s, and began recording his experiences in novels and stories. In the United States his best-known novel is <i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>.</p><h2>Why Not the Best</h2><p>Why One man is optimistic about America&#39;s Third Century - Broadman Press</p><p></p><h2>Coffee with The Buddha (Coffee with...Series)</h2><p>The earth trembles. Lions, tigers, and scorpions grow tame. Humans shower one another with kindness. Such marvels herald a wondrous event: Siddhartha Gautama, known as The Buddha. What knowledge would such a sage have to impart? The Way of the Bodhisattva becomes clear as The Buddha speaks here about suffering and the hardships of life (reminding us that help is always near), impermanence, reincarnation, karma, desire, morality, mindfulness, compassion, love, and the body.&nbsp; Joan Duncan Oliver editorial director of the One Spirit book club and contributor to <i>Tricycle: The Buddhist Review</i> conducts the interview,&#x201d; while singer/composer Annie Lennox, a practicing Buddhist, provides the enlightening preface.</p><p></p><h2>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</h2><p>In this book Bernard Williams delivers a sustained indictment of moral theory from Kant onward. His goal is nothing less than to reorient ethics toward the individual. He deals with the most thorny questions in contemporary philosophy and offers new ideas about issues such as relativism, objectivity, and the possibility of ethical knowledge.</p><p>Bernard Williams was White&#39;s Professor of Moral Philosophy, Oxford, and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy, University of California at Berkeley.Who has not asked--if only when depressed--"How should I live, and how can I find out?" To read this book is to be taken through one of the most sophisticated discussions available of such questions by an engaging, skeptical, often wryly witty and extraordinarily subtle professional. (Ronald de Sousa <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Bernard Williams's book is better read not as an introduction to ethics, but as an attempt to take stock of the present state of the subject. As such, it is a splendid piece of work It illuminatingly maps the various tendencies and the difficulties which they encounter...Such stocktaking is much needed. Bernard Williams is probably the philosopher best placed to undertake it, and he has done it admirably. (Richard Norman <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>Remarkably lively and enjoyable...It is a very rich book, containing excellent descriptions of a variety of moral theories, and innumerable original and often witty observations on topics encountered on the way.

Hunnius contends that Calvin was a "judaizing" theologian&#x2014;one who favored a Rabbinic Jewish interpretation of Old Testament prophecies&#x2014;and that Calvin's interpretations undermined the New Testament teachings concerning the Incarnation, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Hunnius provides the reader with a passionate and substantial refutation of Calvin's flawed interpretations, and upholds the apostolic understanding of the connection between Old Testament Messianic prophecy and the New Testament fulfillment of those prophecies.</p><p></p><h2>Success and failure of Picasso</h2><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;At the height of his powers, Pablo Picasso was the artist as revolutionary, breaking through the niceties of form in order to mount a direct challenge to the values of his time. At the height of his fame, he was the artist as royalty: incalculably wealthy, universally idolized�&#x2c6;&#x2019;and wholly isolated.<br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;In this stunning critical assessment, John Berger�&#x2c6;&#x2019;one of this century's most insightful cultural historians�&#x2c6;&#x2019;trains his penetrating gaze upon this most prodigious and enigmatic painter and on the Spanish landscape and very particular culture that shpaed his life and work. Writing with a novelist's sensuous evocation of character and detail, and drawing on an erudition that embraces history, politics, and art, Berger follows Picasso from his childhood in Malaga to the Blue Period and Cubism, from the creation of <i>Guernica</i> to the pained etchings of his final years. He gives us the full measure of Picasso's triumphs and an unsparing reckoning of their cost�&#x2c6;&#x2019;in exile, in loneliness, and in a desolation that drove him, in his last works, into an old man's furious and desperate frenzy at the beauty of what he could no longer create.</p><p>John Berger was born in London in 1926. He is well known for his novels and stories as well as for his works of nonfiction, including several volumes of art criticism. His first novel, <i>A Painter of Our Time</i>, was published in 1958, and since then his books have included <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, the fiction trilogy <i>Into Their Labours</i>, and the novel <i>G.,</i> which won the Booker Prize in 1972.

In 1885, he moved to London as a freelance writer and successfully sold the Auld Licht Idylls, a volume based on his mother's tales. By the time Peter Pan opened on the London stage in 1904, Barrie had written more than thirty novels and plays, many autobiographical and several of them major hits such as The Little Minister, Quality Street and The Admirable Crichton.

America's belligerent foreign policy is expanding just as fast as the world's refugees, threatening to destroy humanity's last chance for peaceful coexistence. When their own government tries to kill them for exercising the freedoms that people once took for granted, Trent and Donna reluctantly admit that America must be stopped.

In this meandering but satisfying sequel, things have gotten worse, especially in an increasingly paranoid America. Trent and Donna Stinson, of Rock Springs, Wyo., decide to climb into their pickup truck and head for Alpha Centauri. They're a laid-back couple, perfectly willing to share new planets with aliens as long as they can earn enough to live and then relax with a few beers. When the U.S. government interferes and they wind up lost in space, Trent and Donna start working hard to find their way home <i>and</i> clean up the mess back on Earth. There's not much glamour in this space opera, as shown by a weightless Trent struggling to take off lug nuts so he can remove truck tires in interplanetary space. Oltion has carefully thought out the mechanics of such situations, which serve to support the book's upbeat message: If you keep cool, you probably can get out of whatever trouble you've gotten yourself into. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Autumn in my islands ..."<br><br>She sits up quickly in the dark, taking her body by surprise. Her fingers roam her face, a face once nearly flawless. She drags her knuckles down her cheeks.<br><br>Outside, electrified barbed wire hums. She feels such wrenching thirst, she sucks sweat coursing down her arm. Then carefully she rises, gliding like algae through humid air. She listens for the sea. For that is what she longs for--waves cataracting, corroding her to crystals. From somewhere, gurgling latrines. Even their sound is comforting.<br><br>A kerosene lamp is steered into the dark. Sunny watches as dreamily it floats, comes down. A soldier's hand, the hand of memory, places it on the floor, revealing a yeasty, torn mosquito net. Inside, a young girl on a narrow bed, so still she could be dead.<br><br>In watchtowers surrounding the women's compound--twenty Quonset huts, within each, forty women--guards yawn and stroke their rifles. One of them half dozes, dreamily composing an impeccable letter to his family in Osaka. "Mother, we are winning.... The Imperial Japanese Army will prevail!" He is growing thin.<br><br>In one hut a young girl, Kim, pulls her net aside. Burning with pain, she crawls into Sunny's narrow bed, into her arms, and sobs.<br><br>Sunny calms her, whispering, "Yes, cry a little, it will help you sleep."<br><br>"It's hardest when the sky turns light. I think of my family who I will never see again. I want to run outside, throw myself against the fence."<br><br>Sunny sighs, breathes in the smell of sewage, failing flesh. "Kim, be strong. Think of music, think of books--normal things we took for granted."<br><br>"I don't remember normal things." Kim scratches at her sordid legs, a girl of sixteen. "I don't remember life."<br><br>Sunny shakes her gently, feeling mostly bone. "Listen now. When the whistle blows for mustering, we'll stand up straight, eat whatever scraps they throw. No matter how filthy the water, we'll drink. With what is left we'll bathe. We'll do this for our bodies, so our bodies will know we still have hope for a future."<br><br>"What future?" Kim whispers. "Two years of this. I only want to die."<br><br>"Hush, and listen. Death would be too easy, don't you see?" Sunny sighs, begins to drift. "... In Paris now it would be cool. We would stroll the boulevards." Her voice turns dreamy. "We might even take a cab."<br><br>Kim looks up, asking softly, "Will the drivers be rude again?"<br><br>"Oh, yes. And my French is so bad. Maybe this night we would go to Chez L'Ami Louis."<br><br>"Oh! The food is rich, so excellent." Kim momentarily comes alive, for this is her favorite game.

And I will scold you when you pocket the matches, such a tourist thing."<br><br>Her voice softens. She thinks of Keo, their time in Paris. Rocking in lush geometries of morning light, nothing between them but heartbeats. Then spinning under marble arches, through terraced parks, young and careless and exiled. Not seeing Paris collapsing around them, not seeing their lives were crumbling.<br><br>"How happy we were. Grabbing each moment, so alive."<br><br>"I have no such memories," Kim weeps. "I never shall."<br><br>"Of course you will! One day this will end. You will heal. Life will help you to forget."<br><br>"... Yes. Maybe life is waiting in Paris. Beauty and adventure. And shall we walk this evening down the Champs Elys�es? Shop for the softest kid gloves? And cologne? Or maybe take a caf� and wait for Keo. I'll close my eyes, pretend I'm there, just looking on."<br><br>"Shh," Sunny whispers. "Soon it will be daylight. If they find us together, they'll beat us again."<br><br>She feels tears come: hunger, torture, incessant pain, the knowledge that she and this girl--all of them--are dying.<br><br>"Don't think so much. It will consume you. You will never survive."<br><br>"Survive. For what?" Kim's voice grows loud; girls sit up listening behind their nets. "You talk of life. How can we face life after this? How can we face ourselves?"<br><br>Sunny's voice turns urgent. "We must live. Or what have we suffered for? Will these years have been for nothing?"<br><br>Under her pillow is a makeshift map, drawn so she can remember where they are, where they were shipped to months ago. Here is the town of Rabaul on the island of New Britain, east of Papua New Guinea, just north of Australia. Here is the Pacific Ocean and, far to the northeast, Hawai'i. Honolulu, home. Farther out is the world, the great oceans. Far across the Atlantic, there is Paris. Yesterday. But, always, her mind snaps back to Rabaul.<br><br>Exhausted, weak beyond knowing, Kim sinks back on the filthy mattress, stale grains of rice matting her hair. "I want to sleep, I want to dream. Oh, take me back to Paris, shops, cabarets. Tell me again how you and Keo rode in a car with the top down...."<br><br>Paris, Sunny thinks. We were so innocent. Not understanding trains were already leaving stations, streets were darkening with blood. She sighs, begins again, dreamily, and as she talks, girls struggle from their beds, move down the aisle, brushing her mosquito net. Some so thin, their movements seem delicate, some so young they are children, ghosts weaving through a scrim. Wanting only to listen and dream, they sit with arms entwined, heads bowed against each other.<br><br>"... I remember, French women were so chic, and arrogant, always rushing off to rendezvous. I tried to imitate them, to be caustic and quick. It was not in my nature...."<br><br>"And did you paint your nails each day?"<br><br>"And did you drink champagne?"<br><br>She smiles wearily. "Oh, yes. Sometimes we danced all night. Then stood on little bridges, waiting for the sun."<br><br>Kim curls against her, like a child. "Tell us again about your sweetheart. Was he always kind?"<br><br>Sunny weeps a little, and they wait.<br><br>"He was an island man, very kind. And shy. A musician, have I mentioned? So gifted, he played in famous cities. New Orleans.

And mango trees drooping with lianas, shell ginger hanging like pink jewels. Overhead, scraggly palms stretched back and forth across the lane, forming a feathery vaulted ceiling like a long primeval foyer leading him into a forest of shy and friendly tribes.<br><br>Sometimes he stood very still and listened. Mr. Kimuro snoring on his left answered the piping snores of Mr. Silva on the right. Mary Chang's phone rang, and across the lane Dodie Manlapit sat up in bed. He heard the sea, he heard its call. He laid his hand against a tree. I have not lived.

As ...</p><h2>Shade Those Laurels</h2><p>A bizarre whodunit spoof about critics, editors, and writers asks the question--who killed famous writer Mortimer Gussage?</p><p>An elegant, hyperliterary thriller by the late English critic and novelist. Left unfinished at Connolly's death, it has been completed by Oxford scholar and poet Peter Levi. Stephen Kemble, the narrator, is ``an unimportant novel reviewer'' assigned to write the obituary of the very important novelist Sir Mortimer Gussage for the files of a London newspaper. But he manages to lose the obituary--or is it stolen?--while visiting Sir Mortimer at his Wiltshire home. On the morning after Kemble's arrival, Sir Mortimer is found dead, with the obituary on his pillow and a plate of poisonous fruit on his nightstand. Murder? Suicide? Or a simple heart attack? Kemble's attempt to unravel the mystery of Sir Mortimer's death uncovers what turn out to be the even greater mysteries of the old man's life--the uncertain authorship of his books, the undefined status of his ``houseguests,'' the strange goings-on of a secret society called the Gassendi Club--and embroil him in a weird love triangle with Sir Mortimer's widow and daughter. Once the mystery is solved, the Freudian elements of the plot stand forth to reveal a story that is less a matter of crime than aesthetics. Connolly's young writer-- who peers into the remains of his elder--is, in one sense, the real killer of the book, since he ends up occupying the role left vacant by his precursor's death. What begins as a mystery ends as a fable- -a rather cynical metaphor of literary ambition and success. Masterful, sophisticated, and endlessly witty. Levi's portions are unobtrusive and true to the tone set by Connolly. A delightful conceit. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This literary whodunit, set in postwar Britain and replete with literary and gastronomic allusions, was left unfinished by Connolly at his death in 1974 and was completed by Levi, to whom he divulged the denouement. An aristocratic cast of suspects has gathered at the country estate of famed author Sir Mortimer Gussage to celebrate his birthday and knighthood. When Sir Mortimer succumbs later that evening to an untimely death, it falls to his young admirer and protege, Stephen Kemble, to piece together the parts of this intriguing puzzle. Kemble makes his way through drawing rooms, greenhouses, and garden mazes to arrive at a genuinely surprising ending. Levi succeeds in bringing Connolly's stylish mystery to a seamless conclusion.<br><i>- Barbara Love, St. Lawrence Coll., Kingston, Ontario</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wheels of Terror (Cassell Military Paperbacks)</h2><p>The best-selling military writer returns to his comrades in 27th penal battalion, offering another gritty, realistic view of the ordinary soldier in wartime.

His love of women, his fondness for drink, and his loathing for the country prove formidable obstacles on his road to any kind of success. But when he becomes an operative in Operation Kingpin and is charged with monitoring the front runner in Kinjanja&#x2019;s national elections, Morgan senses an opportunity to achieve real professional recognition and, more importantly, reassignment.<br><br>After he finds himself being blackmailed, diagnosed with a venereal disease, attempting bribery, and confounded with a dead body, Morgan realizes that very little is going according to plan.</p><p>Morgan Leafy had high hopes when he first headed out to the small African nation of Kinjanja to serve as Her British Majesty's representative. But once there, Leafy's dreams of professional advancement and personal happiness soon fade: this son of an airport catering manager finds himself overtaken on the career ladder by other, newer recruits to the diplomatic corps who come from the right family and attended the right schools. What's worse, the girl of his dreams has just become engaged to someone younger, thinner, and better connected. And if all this weren't enough to make a career civil servant miserable, Leafy is also being blackmailed by a representative of one of Kinjanja's many political parties who has presented him with a puzzling task: get to know the Scottish medical doctor at a local university. <p> Author William Boyd has written about Africa before, most notably in his bestselling novel <i>Brazzaville Beach</i>. In <i>A Good Man in Africa</i>, Boyd spins a darkly comic tale of political corruption, revolution, sexual misadventure, blackmail, and death. By novel's end, Leafy may not have become a better man--or even a much wiser one--but he has acquired a kind of dignity and gritty courage for which he is well suited.</p>"This is a wildly funny novel, rich in witty prose and raucous incidents . . . without qualification, a delight." -<i>The Washington Post<br><br></i>"Entertaining and successful . . . a champion storyteller.

He was the winner of many awards for his work and career: the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. Among his awards for particular works were the Hugo award in 1963 for "The Dragon Masters", in 1967 for "The Last Castle", and in 2010 for his memoir "This is Me, Jack Vance!" He won a Nebula Award in 1966 for "The Last Castle". He won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1990 for "Lyonesse: Madouc". He also won an Edgar for the best first mystery novel in 1961 for "The Man in the Cage." Vance published more than 60 books in his career, sometimes under pseudonyms. Among them were 11 mystery novels, three of them as Ellery Queen. He wrote some of the first, and perhaps best, examples of "planetary adventures," including a novel called" Big Planet". His Dying Earth series were among the most influential fantasy novels ever written, inspiring both generations of writers, and the creators of Dungeons and Dragons. <br>Vance s series from Tor include "The Demon Princes", "The Cadwal Chronicles", "The Dying Earth", "The Planet of Adventure", and "Alastor". Vance s last novels were a series of two: "Ports of Call" and "Lurulu."<br>Jack Vance was a sailor, a writer, an adventurer, a music critic, and a raconteur.

He died of an overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. This collaborative tribute to Hendrix, described by one of its creators as &#34;not so much outright biography as speculative fantasy,&#34; explores the excitement and the pitfalls of rock stardom sympathetically and perceptively.</p><p>This is a graphic docudrama, an account in comic-strip format of the turbulent life of rock star Jimi Hendrix. Like a cinematic docudrama, it hews to the events of Hendrix's career but creates dialogue and uses various devices--notably, snippets of Hendrix's lyrics as commentary on the action at appropriate moments--to heighten the drama of the guitarist's colorful life. Unfortunately, the events themselves are overly familar to most rock fans, and their treatment here generally falls into rock-star cliches. The banality of much of the imagined dialogue, which frequently lapses into sixties-speak ("Far out," "Dig it man" ), doesn't help. The project is saved, however, because it marks the return to comics of one of the medium's most innovative artists, Bill Sienkiewicz, who's been largely absent from the field for several years. His imaginative, evocative full-color illustrations and narrative mastery supply much-needed substance that turns a rock-bio-in-comics into a genuinely compelling package. Hendrix fans especially will also appreciate the accompanying 30-minute CD of previously unreleased home recordings. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Christmas in My Heart, Vol. 11 (Christmas in My Heart Series, 11)</h2><p>Curl up in your favorite easy chair and savor this collection of 16 classic Christmas tales--the 11th volume in Joe Wheeler&#39;s popular holiday series.

Is there a heaven? </b></p><p><b>Is there a true connection and communication between the living and the dead?</b></p><p>With the success of the television series <i>Medium</i> and her first book, <i>Don't Kiss Them Good-bye</i>, millions of people have embraced Allison, her story, and her remarkable gift. The idea for <i>We Are Their Heaven</i> was born out of the pieces of communication that Allison received from the spirits who touched her over her years as a medium. In this book, she helps people to understand that we are so special to those who have died that they choose to remain with us, not because they're bound but because we are their happiness, we are their heaven.</p><p>Now Allison brings readers into her psychic experiences. As we walk the continuum of life and death with her and meet the people whose lives she has touched, we feel the pain of loss and are at once saddened and then renewed by her experiences and the stories of loss and connection. Each chapter focuses on a different type of loss -- parents, children, friends, and spouses who have lost loved ones through accidents, murder, suicide, and illness.</p><p>Throughout the book, people who have had readings with Allison share their experiences and the significance of their readings. They take us into their confidence and share the unique details, identifying the calling cards of the dead, the initial private piece of information that convinced them that they were communicating directly with their loved ones. Allison, in turn, takes us through the same readings and describes exactly what was delivered and how it was conveyed. She convinces us that an essential part of communicating with the deceased is learning how to read both their signs (the message) and their signature (the unique information). </p><p>Through Allison's eyes, we see that the dead are trying to reach their living loved ones all the time. She explores timing, coincidence, auditory and sensory communications, dreams, visions, incident manipulation, and streaming events to affirm their attempts. Allison presents the riveting details of her communications -- what she hears, sees, and feels. </p><p>Allison's desire to help these two worlds connect makes us want to reach out to her and at the same time fear for her. She shares her daily struggle of living with layers of information that few of us have about others and the world around us. Much like her character on the show, she often struggles with knowing when to intervene and when to keep her knowledge to herself.</p><p>If you miss someone you love, take comfort in the fact that through the thousands of readings that Allison has done, no one has come through to say "good-bye" but rather to say "hello again."</p></p><p><b>Allison Dubois's</b> unique story, the inspiration for the hit NBC TV series <i>Medium,</i> started during her senior year at Arizona State University while she was interning at the D.A.'s office. Soon after, researchers at the University of Arizona validated her ability through a series of tests. Allison continues to support research as a medium, as a member of the Veritas Research Program Mediums Committee, and as a member of the Forever Family Foundation's Medium Advisory Board. In her short career, Allison has conducted over 1,200 personal readings. Allison donates her time to missing-persons and criminal cases for agencies across the country.<b>Introduction</b><p>While writing this book, I decided that giving my perspective is good, but giving my perspective and the perspective of the person whom I read will be more beneficial to my readers. I think it's important for people who are grieving to have others to relate to, people who walk their same path. In this book, the people whom I've read speak in their own words about how they moved forward and what our meeting did for them. I share details about the process of each reading. I also illustrate why being a medium has such a great impact on my life, as well as the lives of my family.</p><p>I met a lot of new people through the media tour for my first book, during radio and television interviews and question-and-answer sessions before book signings. I noticed there are common threads of questions. Many people ask what heaven is like. There is an obvious concern around what happens to our deceased loved ones. People wonder about the connection of the dead to the living. I often get questions from people who are concerned that their mourning a loved one is preventing the loved one from fully passing over to the other side.</p><p>This book addresses some of the various ways in which people die, for example by suicide or accident, and the different ways in which they show us that they remain. A question that I hear often is, Why do the deceased want to remain after death? Well, of course because they love us, but there are other reasons as well. Our deceased relatives want to connect with the living because our lives are based on emotion and continuing to learn and grow, as are their own. They willingly stay with us to share in our emotion and to help teach us what we need to learn. Often they want to make sure that we don't repeat their mistakes, the things they ended up regretting and would do differently if they had the chance. It also brings them a great deal of joy to share in our lives, especially when we're talking about them or to them. It's important to stay open to the messages that are sent from those who go before us, those who are still a part of us. Part of my book's purpose is to open the living up to the spirits who continue to share in their loved ones' lives. Loving people who have died doesn't hold them here, as some think. It gives them life. They stay around us because we are what they consider utopia, their "heaven."</p><p>There is a heaven, a flawless place where we exist after we die. There are white skies and blue water that the eyes of the living cannot see. There are children running through perfect blades of brilliant emerald grass with sunshine bouncing off every strand of their hair. There are old men fishing on the same banks that they fished from when they were boys, with the puppy that died when they were small. Couples who were married for fifty years now look like they did when they were first married, as they stroll hand in hand down a path by a tree. It's all that and more.</p><p>Yet even with all that, it's not entirely heaven to those who've died because, usually, not all their loved ones are there. Try to understand: it's the flaws of the living, our attempts to figure out who we are, how to connect with others, and how to spend our time on earth that interests those who've passed. They want to see how our character stands up when we're challenged. They want to see their namesakes move through life. They want to see children born and anniversaries celebrated, help the sick get better, lend strength to us in times of weakness. Parents who die still want to be there for their kids on the days they're needed most. Children who die want to see their parents, siblings, and friends laugh again and, most important, "feel" their presence and continuing love. So, yes, they have a beautiful sanctuary where everything is as it should be, but never forget that we are their heaven.</p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2006 by Smarter Than They Think, Inc.</p><p></p></p><h2>Mosaic Book: Ideas, Projects &amp; Techniques</h2><p>This companion for contemporary mosaicists, whether beginners or old hands, contains 16 step-by-step projects, ranging from tear-drop glass earrings to a patio design, devised by some of the best mosaic artists.

Asian &amp; Asian American Studies. Moving through past, present and future, this is a family history that journeys between America, Pakistan, modern Europe and even into space. Faisal Mohyuddin delves into the past of his parents and their neighbours in Pakistan and India in a self-consciously impossible attempt to find some way of belonging to a place that is lost. Moving from elegant ghazals of lament to stuttering, disjointed phrases of yearning, Mohyuddin portrays with restrained emotion the complexities of what it is to be displaced, geographically, spiritually, psychologically. With moments of sorrow interspersed with unsettling humour, deep familial love and celebrations of beauty, it is a story recognizable to any who have felt displaced in a new world. If the personal is political, then this is truly poetry for our times.<br>"THE DISPLACED CHILDREN OF DISPLACED CHILDREN demands your attention from its title, which speaks directly to a specific immigrant reflexivity, the way the seam of placelessness both separates and connects generations. In one poem the speaker 'forgets the Urdu / word for loneliness, forgets the Punjabi word for / loneliness, forgets the English word for loneliness.' In another, he finds himself 'holding two large rocks, // looking for something else / sacred to smash open.' These aren't hopeless poems, but they have known hopelessness. What a marvel it is then, this work (and it is work) to turn back toward joy, to create joy despite (or to spite) those forces that would conspire against it. Here, starlight travels centuries just to dazzle us. The son of a father becomes the father of a son. Eternity exists only in mirrors, the book says, then demonstrates. I am such an eager student of this book, this poet, and this light."--Kaveh Akbar<br>"Faisal Mohyuddin's debut collection speaks to the desire to forge a wholeness in a world that seems, too often, to be splitting at the seams. Written with an abiding sense of empathy, and charged with an unmistakable longing, these poems dissolve the boundaries between historical record, memory, and the imagination. Mohyuddin memorialises the suffering of the displaced, while at the same time transforming grief into song, heartache into story, and hunger into wisdom. This collection wrung out my tired heart."--Colum McCann<br>"In these poems, Faisal Mohyuddin assembles a lyrical narrative using historical fact and ethereal longing as material a longing that sprouts from, or settles into, the unlikeliest crevices of the historical-personal. For every gash on the map of partition, there is a gap closing between ceramic tiles affixed on the floor by a mother as she speaks of staying close; for every good king, there is an assassin by the same name; for every assassin, a poet; and for every loss, a legend. What I admire the most in this work is how it confronts and diminishes hubris and elevates the quality of desire to echo the idiom of the mystic 'a longing with an energy and weight all its own, a longing that resides in song or sigh, in prayer or embrace, in caw / or coo.'"--Shadab Zeest Hashmi</p><p>Faisal Mohyuddin, a child of immigrants from Pakistan, is the author of the chapbook <em>The Riddle of Longing</em> (Backbone Press, 2017).

Mariketa the Awaited asked the Lykae behind her without turning around. In the dark of a corridor leading to a burial chamber, Bowen MacRieve had been following her silently. But she'd <i>felt</i> him staring at her -- just as she had at the Talisman's Hie assembly three nights ago. </p><p> "No' likely, witch." How could such a rumbling Scots' burr sound so menacing? "I only stalk what I want to catch." </p><p> Mari did turn to slant him a glance at that, even knowing he couldn't see her face under the hood of the scarlet cloak she always wore. But by the light of her lantern hanging over her shoulder, she could see his, and used the cover to disguise her long, appreciative look. </p><p> She inwardly sighed. Lykae males were notoriously good-looking, and the few she'd seen had lived up to their reputation, but this one was heart-poundingly sexy. </p><p> He had black hair, stick straight and thick, reaching to the collar of his obviously expensive shirt. His body -- which she'd found herself thinking about frequently over the past few days -- was sublime. He stood a good bit over six feet tall, and though the corridor was wide enough for two normal-size people to pass, his broad shoulders and big, rangy build filled the space. </p><p> But even with all his many attractions, his eyes were what made him so unique. They were the color of rich, warm amber, and yet there was a kind of sinister light to them, which she liked. </p><p> She was a little sinister, too. </p><p> "Look your fill?" he asked, his tone scathing. Yes, he was sexy, but unfortunately, his dislike of witches was well known. </p><p> "I'm done with you," she answered, and meant it. She didn't have time to pine after brusque werewolf warriors if she planned to be the first of her kind ever to win the Hie, an immortal scavenger hunt � la <i>The Amazing Race</i>. </p><p> With an inward shrug, she continued on toward yet another burial chamber. This was the tenth she'd investigated over the hours she and several other competitors had been down deep inside this never-ending Mayan tomb. </p><p> She might have surprised him with her curt dismissal because a moment passed before he followed her. The only sounds in the echoing space were his heavy footfalls, which he no longer bothered to muffle. The silence between them was grueling. </p><p> "Who opened the stone slab to the tomb?" he finally asked, trailing far too closely behind her. </p><p> "The three elven archers and a couple of demons." The archers, two males and a female, were deadly shooters with lightning-quick speed, and the male rage demons were incredibly powerful -- second in physical strength only to the Lykae. Yet even for them, the stone portcullis sealing the tomb's entrance had been nearly impossible to budge. </p><p> They'd realized the entire pyramidal structure had shifted from time and earthquakes and now rested on the portcullis, making it weigh tons. Raising it had taken all of the others cooperating -- with the two demons lifting it and the archers shoving an enormous boulder under it to prop it open. </p><p> "And they just let you enter after their effort?" </p><p> She stopped and faced him again. "What should they have done, Mr. MacRieve?" The others had not only allowed her to enter. Though she barely knew any of them, they had wanted to work together since there were four prizes. Cade, one of the demons, had even helped her climb down the dozen feet from the outer entrance into the first anteroom. Then they'd all split up to cover the maze of chambers and vowed to the Lore to alert the others of a find. </p><p> MacRieve's smile was a cruel twist of his lips. "I know exactly what I would have done." </p><p> "I know exactly how I would have retaliated." He seemed surprised that she didn't fear him, but the truth was that she didn't spook easily -- when not faced with heights or unnecessarily large insects. And she was well aware of how vicious the Hie competitors could be as they raced around the world for prizes. </p><p> This ruthlessness in the Hie was why Mari had been sent by the House of Witches to compete, even though she was only twenty-three and hailed from the shady New Orleans coven, the slacker Animal House of witches. And even though she had not yet made the turn from mortal to immortal. </p><p> But Mari was not above trickery, and unlike many witches, she would not hesitate to use magick to harm another if they deserved it -- and if she could manage it with her volatile powers. </p><p> MacRieve closed in until nearly seven feet of seething werewolf male loomed over her. He was at least a foot taller than she was and hundreds of times stronger, but she forced herself to stand her ground. </p><p> "Watch your step, little witch. You doona wish to anger one such as me." </p><p> The grand prize for the Hie was an object called Thrane's Key, a key that allowed its possessor to go back in time -- not just once, but <i>twice</i>. For a tool like that, she knew he was ready to take her out of the contest. So she had to convince him that it was impossible for him to do so. </p><p> "Likewise, you shouldn't anger me." Her voice was steady as she looked up at him. "Remember that I could turn your blood to acid as an afterthought," she said, baldly lying. </p><p> "Aye, I've heard rumors of your power." He narrowed his eyes. "Curious, though, that you dinna open the tomb with one flick of your finger." </p><p> Yes, she might have managed to lift the portcullis -- with concentration, an unprecedented bout of luck, and the absence of a hangover. Oh, and if she were in mortal danger. </p><p> Unfortunately, her power was adrenaline-based, making it as infinite as it was uncontrollable. </p><p> "You think I should use magick like mine to open a tomb?" Mari asked in a scoffing tone. <i>Mistress of bluffing, working it here.</i> "That'd be like calling you in to lift a feather." </p><p> He tilted his head, sizing her up. After what seemed like an hour, he began walking again. </p><p> Mari gave an inward sigh of relief. If anyone in the Lore found out how vulnerable she really was, she'd be doomed. She knew this, but no matter how hard she worked, whenever she manifested and unleashed significant power, things ended up <i>exploding</i>. </p><p> As her befuddled mentor Elianna explained, "Horses have powerful legs -- but that doesn't mean they're prima ballerinas." The ancient Elianna trained with Mari daily to control the destructive nature of her spells, because she believed the subtle magicks invoked the most fear in their enemies. </p><p> And the House of Witches brokered in fear. </p><p> The corridor finally ended at a broad, high wall, covered in carvings of ghoulish faces and animals. Mari lifted her lantern high and the reliefs seemed to move in shadow. They'd apparently been put there to guard a small tunnel opening near the floor, which itself was made out like a gaping mouth with fangs dropping down. </p><p> She waved the Lykae forward. "Age before beauty, Mr. MacRieve." She sized him up again, then studied the small opening, which couldn't be more than three feet square. "If you think you can fit." </p><p> He stood motionless, clearly not about to be directed. "Only humans call me Mr. MacRieve." </p><p> She shrugged. "I'm not a human." Her mother was a fey druidess, and her late father had been a warlock of questionable repute. So Mari was a fey witch or a "weylock," as her buddies teased. "So would you like me to call you Bowen, or Bowe for short?" </p><p> "Bowe is what my friends call me, so you doona." </p><p> <i>What an ass</i>...."No problem. I have a slew of other more fitting names for you. Most of them end in <i>er</i>." </p><p> He ignored her comment. "You in the tunnel first." </p><p> "Don't you think it'd be unbecoming for me to be on my hands and knees in front of you? Besides, you don't need my lantern to see in the dark, and if you go first, you'll be sure to lose me and get to the prize first." </p><p> "I doona like anything, or anyone, at my back." He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned a shoulder against a snarling visage on the stone wall. She'd never seen a Lykae turn into its towering werewolf form, but knew from those who had that this male could be as frightening as any monster, real or imagined. "And you'll have your little red cloak on," he continued, "so I will no' be able to see anything about you that might be...unbecoming." </p><p> "Twisting my words? I'll have you know that I am criminally cute -- " </p><p> "Then why hide behind a cloak?" </p><p> "I'm not <i>hiding</i>." In fact, that was precisely what she was doing. "And I like to wear it." She <i>hated</i> it. </p><p> Even before her birth, she'd been predicted to be the Awaited One, the most powerful born to the House of Witches in centuries -- but four years ago, it was also foretold that a male from the Lore would recognize her as his own and claim her. He would seek to lock her away, guarding her with a ferocity that no magicks could defeat, thus robbing the House of her powers. </p><p> Since the prediction, she'd been forced to cover herself every single time she set foot outside her home. Needless to say, the robust dating life of her late teens had taken a hit. </p><p> She sported the cloak -- a red one because she was a Scarlet Letter-type rebel at heart -- and as a backup, she also hid behind a magickal glamour that disguised her looks, the tone of her voice, and her scent. </p><p> If a male like MacRieve did see her, he would perceive a brunette with blue eyes -- when in fact she was a redhead with gray eyes -- and he would have difficulty recalling anything that was the same, like her features, her figure, or the length of her hair. The glamour was so second nature that she hardly thought about it anymore. </p><p> Even with all these precautions, it followed that unattached males in the Lore were to be avoided. Yet Mari had heard at the Hie assembly -- a gossip fest if she'd ever seen one -- that MacRieve had already found his mate and lost her more tha...</p></p><h2>Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)</h2><p>In <b>A Free Man of Color</b>, <b>Fever Season</b>, and <b>Graveyard Dust</b>, Benjamin January penetrated the murkiest corners of glittering old New Orleans to bring murderers to justice.

The movement springs from the desire to change or transform human behavior through the medium of theatre. In this book, Philip Taylor offers strategies for using theatre to raise awareness, propose alternatives, provide healing, and implement community change. As he demonstrates, applied theatre teaches us to teach others, helps communities deal with issues, and gives voice to the views of the silent and the marginal. In numerous examples, Taylor shows exactly how the theatrical art form is being harnessed to help communities question aspects of who they are and what they aspire to be.</p><p><p>Philip Taylor is Director of New York University's Program in Educational Theatre. His previous publications with Heinemann include Applied Theatre: Creating Transformative Encounters in the Community (2003) and Redcoats and Patriots: Reflective Practice in Drama and Social Studies (1998).</p>&#x201c;I am convinced that the book Applied Theatre - like applied theatre itself - can unleash us from our constrained visions of what the arts in general, and the theatre in particular, can be, and of what they can help us become.&#x201d;&#x2013;Tom Barone, Arizona State University</p><h2>The Mystery of Golf: A Brief Account of Its Origen, Antiquity &amp; Romance; Its Uniqueness; Its Curiousness; &amp; Its Difficulty; Its Anatomical, ... Concepts on Other Matters to It Appertaining</h2><p>Foreword by Herbert Warren Wind In the opinion of many leading scholars of the sports world, what Izaak Walton&#39;s The Compleat Angler is to books on fishing, Arnold Haultain&#39;s The Mystery of Golf is to books on golf. Whether or not this is an excessive rating, there can be no disputing that Haultain&#39;s treatise is both a historically important document and an extraordinarily evergreen entertainment. As such, it is a minor classic. The Mystery of Golf was first published in 1908 in a limited edition, then republished in 1910 in a general edition. This current edition is a reprint of one published in 1965 and retains the Foreword by Herbert Warren Wind. Haultain, born in 1857, was a Canadian belletrist. 160 pp 5 x 7</p><p>Originally published in 1908, <i>The Mystery of Golf</i> was the first book to seriously ruminate over that problematic region known as the golfer's mind and the obsessive hold the game has on it. Haultain suggests there are three unfathomables that have gripped the minds of men: metaphysics, golf, and the female heart. "The Germans, I believe, pretend to have solved some of the riddles of the first," he writes, "and the French to have unraveled some of the intricacies of the last; will someone tell us," he pleads almost rhetorically, "wherein lies the extraordinary fascination of golf?" <p> Of course, Haultain goes on to do just that, and John Updike, for one, raves about the effort. "The book's core," writes the prose master of <i>Golf Dreams</i>, "is pure gold.... Haultain goes to the heart of golf's peculiar loveability and enduring fascination." Much has changed in the game since Haultain penned this delightfully quaint tome, except for that elusive heart, which remains every bit as peculiar and enduring as it was when Haultain first opened it up for examination. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Arnold Haultain was born in India to British parents but lived most of his</p><h2>Anti-Semitism in Times of Crisis</h2><p><p>The question of whether anti-Semitism is a transitory phenomenon, appearing randomly in Western history, or whether it reflects a deep seated tradition inherent in Western culture has been often debated.

The majority of these extraordinary dwellings began as ordinary terrace houses, built to a pattern, often in pairs or small groups. Clusters exist in the East End of London: in Spitalfields, Whitechapel, Shadwell, Mile End. They are mostly Grade II-listed, and their owners put up with the bone-curdling cold of winter howling through gaps, with mending and color-matching, patching and piecing.

He can see everything, but when he doesn't see Mommy Owl, he starts to listen . . . .</p><p>With language that emphasizes sound words and listening skills, this is a reassuring bedtime story for little night owls everywhere.</p></p><p>Toni Yuly has been an early bird all her life, and loves to start the day in the studio listening to other early birds sing outside her window. She was born in Seattle and now lives in Bremerton, Washington, in a small house by the water. She studied painting at the University of Washington, where she worked with the great American painter Jacob Lawrence. In addition to making art, Toni works in the King County library system. Night Owl is her first book for children.PreS-K&#x2014;In a gentle tale suffused in purple and black tones, little Night Owl happily greets the night. But where is his mother? In a series of onomatopoeic moments, the owlet hears different sounds and wonders if it's his mother's. Alas, each one reveals a cricket, a train, a toad or other source of the sound&#x2014;but no mother. When a storm crashes in, the owlet wings bravely home to his tree where his mother soon joins him. With the simplest of lines, Yuly imbues her owl baby with great character. Reminiscent of Martin Waddell's Owl Babies (Candlewick 1992), the simple text is suited for group sharing or one-on-one with toddlers, who will happily join in with making the sounds. The little creature portrayed in bold pen and ink and digital pictures will capture readers with his resiliency and calm.&#x2014;Marge Loch-Wouters, La Crosse Public Library, WI</p><h2>Grill This, Not That!: Backyard Survival Guide</h2><p>Bestselling authors David Zinczenko and Matt Goulding return with the latest in their blockbuster series, Eat This, Not That!

San Francisco's Asian Art Museum was a pioneering advocate for bringing Korean art into this country.

She has spent most of her life in California, and lives in Los Angeles.Chapter 1<br>The first time I saw my father as a woman was at the grand old restaurant Musso &amp; Frank Grill on Hollywood Boulevard. He had called me the week before asking if we could meet for lunch, as he had something important he wanted to discuss. It sounded serious, but he didn&#x2019;t want to speak about it on the telephone. I had my suspicions as to what the conversation might be about, but nothing could have prepared me for that notable afternoon.<br>I arrived at noon, and Musso&#x2019;s was buzzing with its regular upscale crowd and a battalion of aging Italian waiters who were as stiff as the white table linens.<br>My heart sank when I saw a frightful-looking character coyly flagging a paisley handkerchief in my direction. I thought, &#x201c;Dear God, please don&#x2019;t let this be my father.&#x201d;<br>The distant sight of him made me feel faint, like I was being pulled to my knees by a magnetic force. I&#x2019;d grown up in Hollywood, and I&#x2019;d certainly seen my share of cross-dressers, transvestites, and transsexuals, but this was my dad. We used to come here for hot flannel cakes when I was a child. I forged my way to the brown leather booth where he had positioned himself, and put on my nicest smile like nothing was out of the ordinary. As he stood up to greet me, I said, &#x201c;Hi Dad,&#x201d; and lightly pecked his powdered cheek.<br>In place of the handsome, he-man race-car driver that I remembered stood an unknown, eerie entity. As he leaned over to kiss me I smelled his familiar scent of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s, only this time it was mixed with a spritz of eau de gardenia. The sweet, musty odor reminded me of crumpled perfumed tissues mixed with cherry LifeSavers. He smelled like my grandmother&#x2019;s purse. As we sat down, he crossed his bony nylon-clad legs and daintily folded his large hands in front of him.<br>&#x201c;Are you surprised?&#x201d; he beamed.<br>I wasn&#x2019;t really sure how to respond. I think &#x201c;mortified&#x201d; was the feeling, but not wanting to spoil his moment, I replied, &#x201c;Yep, I&#x2019;m truly amazed.&#x201d;<br>My dad couldn&#x2019;t wait to fill me in on all the scary details of his operation. As he explained how the doctor nipped off his private parts and constructed a new vagina, I was completely lost in his shocking transformation.<br>He was wearing artificial, spiky, long eyelashes with iridescent blue eye shadow. He had lined his pale blue eyes with black liner and painted on the old-fashioned fishtails curling up at the ends. Dramatic, heavy brown eyebrows scrawled down to his temples, and pasty pancake foundation gave his complexion a dull, deathlike pallor. His lips were stained in a blaze of scarlet, and silver hoop earrings dangled from his large earlobes. I noticed that his gold Rolex had been replaced with the smaller female version, and feminine rings that I recognized as belonging to his late wife, Loren, were squeezed onto his swollen fingers. He held onto a fifties-style red handbag and wore matching red pumps with one wonky heel.<br>More strange was seeing my dad in full female regalia. He was wearing a fancy knit ensemble with a short, slim-fit skirt that showcased his stick-straight legs. To top off the whole new look, he had donned a long auburn thatch that sat slightly askew on his graying pate. The entire image was a fright.<br>When the waiter came to take our order, my dad suddenly developed laryngitis, and in a scratchy, high-pitched whisper ordered the grilled chops and another Jack on the rocks. My appetite had pretty much vanished when I walked in the door, but in my cheeriest tone I ordered the seafood salad and a Hires root-beer float. The waiter took off, and my dad&#x2019;s deep timbre suddenly came back. I guess we had fooled him; just a couple of nice girls out for an afternoon lunch.<br>&#x201c;So what do you think? How do I look?&#x201d; he gushed.<br>The only word I could think of was &#x201c;scary,&#x201d; but I managed to squeak out, &#x201c;Very nice, you look great, if this is what makes you happy.&#x201d;<br>My dad stared at me like I&#x2019;d lost my mind and slurred, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not gay, you know, I only did this so I would never be unfaithful to Loren, God rest her soul.&#x201d;<br>I was beginning to lose the plot. Wasn&#x2019;t this just a little excessive? I heard that a person had to go through an extensive psychiatric assessment before even being considered for this sort of procedure. It was obvious that my father was out of touch.<br>He went on to tell me that he had made some new friends in Palm Springs, and that they hadn&#x2019;t a clue that he was a transsexual. He wanted me to come out to the desert and to introduce me to these people. As what, I wondered, his daughter or her daughter? Was he supposed to be my mom now? I definitely had to draw the absurd line somewhere.<br>My dad liked to smoke cigarettes while he ate and now had two Lucky Strikes burning, one gripped between his fingertips and the other smoldering away in the ashtray. I noticed that he had spilled a spot of A-1 sauce on the front of his jacket, and smiled to myself remembering how my grandfather used to tease me, saying, &#x201c;Baby, you look good in everything you eat.&#x201d;<br>I passed him my napkin so he could wipe off the sauce, then tactfully doused the extra burning butt with a teaspoon of water. I could see the booze was beginning to take effect, which always made my dad a bit maudlin and tearfully sentimental. He broke down.<br>&#x201c;Thank God I found you, you&#x2019;re all I have left in the world.&#x201d;<br>He professed how much he loved me, but I wasn&#x2019;t biting. It was true, next to him I was the last surviving member of his family, but he&#x2019;d always known exactly where to find me. It was he who had stayed away from me. I continued sipping my float to the noisy last drop, when all of a sudden he burst into tears. Something about seeing my dad cry was disarming. I had spent the last hour trying to dismiss him as a nutter, but now I felt a cold chill. There was a real person lost somewhere in there. This was the man who had given me life. I managed to choke out the uncomfortable words, &#x201c;And I love you too.&#x201d;<br>We&#x2019;d already had three different servers wait on our table, and when the fourth waiter came to bring the check I realized something was up. They were all taking turns, coming to gaze at my garishly made-up father. My dad rummaged through his red handbag and handed me a heap of credit cards held together with a rubber band. He asked me to sign the check, as he was going to go &#x201c;freshen up.&#x201d; Everyone in the restaurant stared openly as he drunkenly tottered past their tables on his way to the powder room.<br>Shuffling through the lot of cards I noticed he&#x2019;d already changed his name on every one of them. Even his driver&#x2019;s license read sex: female, height: 6'4". Instead of Robert he was now Robin. It was all so shockingly official.<br>I started to realize that this whole transformation had been long thought out. I was pretty sure it didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with being faithful to Loren. If anything, he&#x2019;d had to wait for her to die before he could go through with the procedure. My stepmother had been a jealous, suspicious witch. I was sure that if she had had even an inkling of this possibility, she would have divorced him and sued his pantyhose off. Hmm, she did die rather suddenly. The coroner said it was heart failure. Wow! What if he really killed her! With that frightening thought, I signed the receipt &#x201c;Robin James,&#x201d; collected my belongings, and went to see what was taking the old girl so long in the ladies&#x2019; room.<br>On entering I found my father leaning close to the mirror dabbing on a little more Max Factor pancake. As he applied more crimson lipstick, I had an anxious feeling, like I was about to be caught doing something I shouldn&#x2019;t, but what I wasn&#x2019;t sure. I worried that some unsuspecting female diner would breeze into the powder room and get a shock.<br>While my dad was taking his/her time preening in the mirror, I urgently needed to pee. I eyed the vacant stall, then looked back at his reflection in the glass. If it had been a girlfriend or even a beau with me, I wouldn&#x2019;t have thought twice about it, but something about my dad in the ladies&#x2019; room dressed like Aunt Bea made it a little too intimate, so I decided I could hold it. Here I was in a little pink bathroom on Hollywood Boulevard watching my father put the final touches on his already overly made-up face. He took a tissue, folded it in half, and carefully blotted his lips. It was an old-fashioned technique he must have learned from observing his late wife. With one last glance in the mirror he was ready to meet the public.<br>I held the door open, thinking he would exit before me and I would trail inconspicuously behind, but he politely waited for me to catch up. Like a tipsy jester, he took my arm and we slowly paraded through the dining room of Musso &amp; Frank. When we reached the exit, he stopped and waited for me to open the door, and I respectfully held it ajar. He asked if I wouldn&#x2019;t mind giving him a ride to his hotel, and again took my arm as we plodded to the parking lot. Seeing my little black VW convertible in the distance brought a welcome sense of reality. Not wanting to tarry, I tipped the valet a fiver and made a beeline for the Volkswagen. When we got settled in I literally breathed a sigh of relief. I glanced over at my father, who was still getting situated in the seat beside me. His knee-length skirt was hiked up to his thighs, exposing two shriveled wads of nylon lying limp between his legs. I knew they were some sort of stockings, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure what the extra hanging bits were. On closer inspection, I realized he was wearing two sets of pantyhose, one pair on each leg....</p><h2>The Prints of Louis Lozowick: A Catalogue Raisonne</h2><p>Bound in publisher&#39;s original decorated maroon cloth, spine stamped in gilt.

As well as famous figures such as Copernicus, Darwin and Einstein, there are also the obscure, the eccentric, even the mad. This diverse cast includes, among others, Andreas Vesalius, landmark 16th-century anatomist and secret grave-robber; the flamboyant Galileo, accused of heresy for his ideas; the obsessive, competitive Newton, who wrote his rivals out of the history books; Gregor Mendel, the Moravian monk who founded modern genetics; and Louis Agassiz, so determined to prove the existence of ice ages that he marched his colleagues up a mountain to show them the evidence.</p><p>John Gribbin is one of today&#39;s greatest writers of popular science and the author of bestselling books, including In Search of Schroedinger&#39;s Cat, Stardust and Deep Simplicity. He is famous to his many fans for making complex ideas simple, and says that his aim in his writing - much of it done with his wife, Mary Gribbin - is to share with his readers his sense of wonder at the strangeness of the universe.

But as bass player of Blur - one of the most successful British bands of all time - his journey was more exciting and extreme than he could ever have predicted. Success catapulted him from a slug-infested squat in Camberwell to a world of private jets and world-class restaurants. As &#39;the second drunkest member of the world&#39;s drunkest band&#39; life was always chaotic, but Alex James retained a boundless enthusiasm and curiosity at odds with his hedonistic lifestyle. From nights in the Groucho with Damien Hirst, to dancing to Sister Sledge with Bjork, to being bitten on the nose by the lead singer of Iron Maiden, he offers a fascinating and hilarious insight into the world of celebrity. At its heart, however is the picaresque tale of one man&#39;s search to find meaning in an increasingly surreal world. Pleasingly unrepentant but nonetheless a reformed man, Alex James is the perfect chronicler of his generation - witty, observant, frank and brimming with joie de vivre.

In 1862 he teamed up with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel and the two men entered into one of the most fruitful relationships in literary history.&nbsp; Verne remains best known for <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth,</i> <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>, <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>, and <i>The Mysterious Island</i>.&nbsp; By the end of his life in 1905, Verne had published more than sixty books.</strong>Jules Verne never took a trip to the moon, never journeyed to the center of the earth, never traveled twenty thousand leagues under the sea&#x2014;and he never went around the world at all, let alone in eighty days. And yet, in his imagination, he made all these journeys and many more. Although he is widely considered to be the father of science fiction, Verne did not write sci-fi as we know it today&#x2014;he didn't write about aliens or galactic empires or time travel or even (with a few exceptions) the future&#x2014;but rather like Michael Crichton in our own time, he wrote adventure stories about epic journeys set in the present day that were right at the edge of what was technologically possible during his lifetime. The most lighthearted of these epic journeys, <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> is the story of a single-minded, freakishly decisive Londoner named Phileas Fogg who, on a moment's notice one day in 1872, takes off round the world as fast as he can with his newly hired French manservant and a valise full of cash, for no better reason than to win a bet. <p></p>Verne's own life was adventurous only in his imagination. Born the son of an attorney in the French port city of Nantes in 1828, he wrote in later life that he grew up fascinated by the clipper ships and schooners he saw along the docks, but apart from some amateur boating with his brother Paul along the Loire River, he was never so fascinated that he ever attempted to run away to sea. Instead, to please his father, he dutifully followed the career track of an ordinary bourgeois Frenchman, studying law in Paris and working as a stockbroker. The young Verne's aspiration to be something more than a businessman expressed itself as literary ambition rather than wanderlust, and from the age of twenty he began to publish plays and short stories, at first to little acclaim. It was not until he teamed up with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel in 1862 that he found success with his first novel-length adventure story, <i>Five Weeks in a Balloon</i>, which was an instant best seller. Hetzel declined to publish Verne's next novel, <i>Paris in the Twentieth Century</i>&#x2014;one of his few truly futuristic tales and one that was not published until after his death&#x2014;but nonetheless the two men entered into one of the most fruitful relationships in literary history between an author and a publisher. Shrewdly packaged by Hetzel as a series under the title &#x201c;Extraordinary Voyages in the Known and Unknown Worlds,&#x201d; the books for which Verne remains best known were written between 1864 and 1874, including <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> (1864), <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i> (1865), <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i> (1869), and <i>The Mysterious Island</i> (1874). Verne's mutually successful relationship with his publisher continued even after Hetzel's death in 1886, when Pierre-Jules' son, Louis-Jules, took over the company. Apart from one trip to America (where he never got further west than Niagara Falls), a visit to London, and some travels around the Mediterranean and other places in Europe, Verne never did see much of the world he wrote about so vividly,&nbsp; He was content instead to live the comfortable life of a successful author in the provincial French city of Amiens. Maybe this was because he simply could not spare the time away from his desk&#x2014;by the end of his life in 1905, he had published more than sixty books&#x2014;but for a man who had been to the moon, at the earth's core, and around the world in his imagination, perhaps the real world did not hold that much interest.<p></p>Published originally as a newspaper serial in 1872 and released as a book the following year, <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> was an immediate success. It was the best selling of Verne's books during his lifetime&#x2014;108,000 copies, according to his publisher, compared to only 50,000 for <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>&#x2014;and it remains one of his most popular books today. Some of that continued interest comes from the fact that this is one of Verne's deliberately comic books, written as much to amuse as to awe the reader. The set-up itself is inherently comic. The protagonist, Phileas Fogg, is a leisured but taciturn Londoner of such mathematically precise habits that he has fired his servant for bringing him shaving water two degrees too cold. Early in the novel he enters into the sort of argument between idle men which nowadays would likely be started in a bar after two or three beers, but in Verne's mildly parodic version of moneyed Englishmen at play, starts over a game of whist at a gentleman's club. It ends as most such arguments do, with bravado and a foolish bet: Fogg wagers the other card players twenty thousand pounds (a huge sum in 1872) that he can travel around the world in eighty days or less. Then, after coolly playing whist for another twenty-five minutes, he returns home, collects the servant he hired that very morning&#x2014;the excitable Frenchman Passepartout&#x2014;and leaves for the train station with Passepartout and a carpetbag full of twenty thousand pounds in cash.<p></p>Verne was writing during a great age of European literature, when writers like the Russian Leo Tolstoy, the Englishwoman George Eliot, and Verne's fellow Frenchman Gustave Flaubert were creating the modern novel. In the works of these authors the intimate lives of characters are evoked with great psychological complexity. Jules Verne, however, was an entertainer, and as in the work of popular novelists of our own day, his characters are merely complex enough for his purposes, which is to say they are simply but vividly drawn, sturdy enough to support the plot. Despite their epic scope, Verne's novels often depend on the interactions of a limited number of main characters, and in <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i>, Verne limits himself to Fogg, Passepartout, and the British detective Fix, as well as, to a limited extent, the Indian princess Aouda. The three male characters conform easily to stereotypes of nationality and class: Fogg is a distilled version of the practical, decisive Englishman, interested only in winning his bet. Except as it makes his journey easier or more difficult, he takes no note of the cultures he is passing through. Passepartout is likewise a stock character, the plucky, devoted, resourceful servant who is also an excitable, voluble Frenchman. The English detective Fix&#x2014;who trails Fogg because he suspects Fogg has robbed the Bank of England&#x2014;can be boiled down to the adjectives wily and dogged. The Indian princess Aouda barely registers as a character at all, scarcely speaking throughout the book and serving first as a plot point, when she is rescued from the Indian ritual of suttee by Fogg and Passepartout, and then as a generic love interest for Fogg. <p></p>Although these characters scarcely transcend their rudimentary nature, the two main travelers, Fogg and Passepartout, are surprisingly memorable, almost because of their sketchiness. Passepartout is very much the reader's surrogate, the only person in the book who shows any curiosity or wonder about the places they are passing through. His adventure on his own in the streets of Yokohama, Japan, in chapters 22 and 23 is one of the few moments in the book where Verne slows down enough to take in some local color&#x2014;which he gleaned entirely from other accounts, not from personal experience. And the excitable Frenchmen is also the closest thing in the book to an action hero. Although Fogg gets the credit when Aouda is rescued from her husband's funeral pyre in India in chapter 13, it is Passepartout who actually, physically saves her, at considerable risk to himself. The same is true during an attack by the Sioux on their train as they cross the Nebraska prairie; it is Passepartout who stops the train by crawling under the cars to unhook them from the engine. <p></p>As for Fogg, he is memorable chiefly because he is such a blank. If Passepartout is a comic stereotype of an emotional Frenchman, Phileas Fogg is a distilled version of a French author's stereotype of the cool, unflappable English eccentric. He seems to have sprung from nowhere, having no family or friends, and he seems to have a lot of money, though no one knows where it comes from. His behavior and his manner seem to a modern reader to be borderline autistic: as he waits to interview Passepartout in chapter 1, all Fogg does is watch the clock, and indeed, in the next chapter, he is described by Verne as being as exactly regulated as a chronometer. He has no apparent interest in the social, cultural, or political worlds of London, or even in other people, for, as Verne writes, "as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody." <p></p>His only pastime, as far as we can see, is playing cards at his gentleman's club, but even that does not seem to give him any pleasure: "Mr. Fogg played not to win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes." His sudden decision to travel around the world in eighty days is undertaken in the same spirit. He is clearly not interested in the money, since over the course of the book he spends as much as he is likely to win, and, as already noted, he shows no more interest in the countries he passes through than he does in his own. Depicted as watching the clock in his own home in chapter 1, he spends the rest of the book racing the clock, taking little note of anything along the way except for train and steamship schedules. Only occasionally does Verne hint that there might be more to Fogg, as when he risks the success of his trip (and his fortune as well) to rescue Aouda from the ceremony of suttee, or when he takes time to rescue Passepartout from the Sioux. Only at the end of the book does he expresses strong emotion, and then only twice&#x2014;once with a punch and once with a declaration of love. <p></p>Fogg's lack of interest in the world as he circles it is almost mirrored by the book's own, at least to begin with. Once the journey is started, it proceeds at a breakneck pace. Verne skips Europe entirely; at the end of chapter 4, Fogg and Passepartout are riding the train out of London, and when we see them next, in chapter 6, they are already in the Egyptian port of Suez. Apart from a couple of adventures in India&#x2014;a ride on an elephant and the rescue of Aouda from her dead husband's funeral pyre&#x2014;and from Passepartout's extended interlude in Japan, Asia goes by in a blur, with the descriptions of the geography and history of the countries they pass through reading as if they came out of guidebooks (which they almost certainly did). Even the action sequences, which most novelists would milk for every drop of suspense, are often rushed through, as if Verne were watching the time as carefully as Fogg is. On the other hand, Verne had a lifelong fascination with America, and he slows down in the American section of Fogg's journey to give us several striking scenes in this (to a Frenchman) exotic country: a political riot in San Francisco, a challenge to a duel from a boorish American officer, a potted history of the Mormons, an Indian attack on a train, culminating in a wild ride across the improbably flat Nebraska prairie on a wind-driven sledge. The fact that most of this is secondhand and unrealistic&#x2014;the Sioux attacking a moving train from horseback in the dead of a Nebraska winter, for example&#x2014;does not diminish the sequence's sheer narrative drive.&nbsp; <p></p>In the end, in fact, the reader's interest in following the story is essentially the same as Fogg's reason for undertaking the trip, and the same as Verne's apparent motive for writing the book, namely a fascination with the sheer physical challenge of circling the globe in an age before air travel. This is perhaps the main reason for the novel's continuing appeal: <i>Around the World</i> <i>in Eighty Days</i> does not depend as much on scientific extrapolation as some of his other novels do. Unlike his novels about journeys that were improbable, as least in his day&#x2014;going to the moon, riding in a submarine&#x2014;or even flat out impossible&#x2014;in reality no one can travel to the center of the earth&#x2014;<i>Around the World in Eight Days</i> is about a trip that relies chiefly on technology that was already forty years old (the railroad and the steamship) or even older (sailing ships and elephants), and the narrative interest in the book comes not from his depiction of cutting-edge technology or natural spectacle, but from the more ordinary obstacles Verne throws in Phileas Fogg's path. &#x201c;The unforeseen does not exist,&#x201d; says Fogg, before he has ever left London, and the fun of the novel results from just how wrong he turns out to be. Verne may have shared the average man's fascination with the technology of his day, but he was a clever enough dramatist to understand that the story works best when the technology breaks down. The promised railway across India peters out in the jungle, forcing Fogg to buy an elephant; having missed his steamship connection in Hong Kong, he bribes a captain to take his sailing ship through a storm; and in the final leg of his trip, he buys a steamship outright and burns the wooden superstructure piece by piece in order to keep the steam up.<p></p>Because of the striking simplicity of the story and the uncomplicated vividness of Fogg and Passepartout, Verne's story of a feisty Englishman charging unflappably around the world lives on remarkably well, especially considering that today a man of Fogg's means could simply buy a plane ticket and do the trip in a day or two. Verne himself capitalized on the book's success by turning it into a successful stage spectacular that earned him ten million francs, which is more than most of his books did. In 1889 and 1890, much to Verne's delight, an American woman, the pioneering female journalist Nellie Bly, traveled around the world in seventy-two days, beating Fogg's record. The novel has been filmed several times, most notably in 1956 as a Cinemascope epic starring David Niven as a dapper Fogg and the Mexican comedian Cantinflas as Passepartout. More recently it has been made into a television miniseries starring Pierce Brosnan as Fogg and former Monty Python member Eric Idle as Passepartout, and even more recently as a comedy with Steve Coogan as Fogg and the martial arts star Jackie Chan as his servant. Perhaps the most memorable modern adaptation, however, was the work of another former member of Monty Python, the writer and comedian Michael Palin, who in 1989 reenacted Fogg's trip for a nonfiction BBC television series and book, trying to see if he could make it round the world in eighty days without flying.<p></p>It is ironic that the author of one of the most archetypical fictional narratives of travel was a mild, middle-class Frenchman who not only hardly ever left France, but who, judging from his astonishing output, scarcely even left his study. Later writers like Joseph Conrad and Graham Greene would write with more depth and power about Europeans abroad, and in our own time narratives that cross borders and travel the world are written by writers who would have been considered mere colorful "natives" from the perspective of a European in Verne's day, such as the Indian novelists V. S. Naipaul and Salman Rushdie. But the fact that the best of Verne's books are still read and enjoyed is a testament to the power of his imagination and his skill as an entertainer. Like the best popular writers in any era, he knew how to take a simple, striking idea and dramatize the hell out of it, with a headlong plot full of trains, ships, elephants, and wind sledges, not to mention human sacrifice, ...</p><h2>2008 Calorie King Calorie, Fat &amp; Carbohydrate Counter</h2><p>The average reader is either trying to lose weight, eat healthier, or reduce health risks such as diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer.

I live to design and create. But for me, designing goes beyond the actual design. I think of the world around the design&#x2014;the environment, mood, ambience, emotion, and spirit&#x2014;as attached to the creative process. I have always asked myself, How do we live with design? How does design affect our lives? How do the clothes we wear, the homes we choose, the objects of our life communicate to the world who we are? I think of the way we live not as lifestyle but as a life <i>of style.</i> And to think in these terms you can&#x2019;t just look at the outside of style&#x2014;you need to look at the inside of style. You need to understand the origins of how our style is derived, to appreciate why we love what we love.<br><br>And so I decided to put pen (and brush) to paper and start my own <i>style journey.</i> I needed to reflect on the source of all this love and passion. What made me develop into the person I am? How did my style evolve? Is style genetic, cultural, or life experience? I wanted to understand what my style DNA consisted of.<br><br>Was it Grandma Fanny&#x2019;s plastic-slipcovered King Louis sofa? My mother&#x2019;s forever un-matching chairs&#x2014;and the incredible generosity in her home? Maybe a lifetime of old Hollywood films? My father, &#x201c;the Cowboy&#x201d;? Perhaps my first trip to Paris to meet Pierre Cardin? My first fashion show in Milan? My lavender bedroom in Secaucus? My first pair of hot pants? (Mom bought them at Bloomie&#x2019;s.) Capri?

Style is a reflection of who we are, where we come from, and what we have experienced&#x2014;the good, the bad, and the indifferent. It is what makes us into the unique beings that we are.<br><br>Having the courage to ask ourselves what we love <i>and why</i> is to really begin the process of understanding our style and enhancing the way we live and communicate who we are to the world around us.<br><br>Living a stylish life is not about buying designer clothes or retaining the &#x201c;it&#x201d; decorator of the moment.

The singer, guitarist, and songwriter--best known for his work with Wilco--opens up about his past, his songs, the music, and the people that have inspired him. Few bands have inspired as much devotion as the Chicago rock band Wilco, and it&#39;s thanks, in large part, to the band&#39;s singer, songwriter, and guiding light: Jeff Tweedy. But while his songs and music have been endlessly discussed and analyzed, Jeff has rarely talked so directly about himself, his life, and his artistic process. Until now. In his long-awaited memoir, Jeff will tell stories about his childhood in Belleville, Illinois; the St. Louis record store, rock clubs, and live-music circuit that sparked his songwriting and performing career; and the Chicago scene that brought it all together.

The Coming of the Horseclans (originally published in 1975) was the first of 18 novels in the sequence, which ended, with The Clan of the Cats (1988), only on account of the author&#x2019;s death. His non-Horseclans work included two other series. Castaways in Time (1980) and its five sequels were a mix of alternate history and time travel. The Stairway to Forever and Monsters and Magicians (both 1988) were the only volumes to appear of a projected fantasy series. He also co-edited several anthologies, among them Barbarians (1985, with Martin H. Greenberg and Charles H. Waugh), four Magic in Ithkar volumes (1985-87, with Andre Norton), Robert Adams&#x2019; Book of Alternate Worlds (1987, with Pamela Crippen Adams and Martin H. Greenberg) and Robert Adams&#x2019; Book of Soldiers (1988, same co-editors).</p><h2>Charmed Season 9 Volume 3</h2><p>The years have passed quickly for The Charmed Ones since they learned of their magical heritage. In only one decade they have experienced so much love and loss, joy and sorrow, failure and success. But time marches on and new challenges will be met as Phoebe is haunted by her past, Piper must deal with the present, and Paige is forced to cope with the future. But none of those events will prepare them to face the truth behind a family secret that could change everything for the Warren line!</p><p></p><h2>Eats: A Folk History of Texas Foods</h2><p>"Folklore, which delves into the culture of peoples, may be a more important study about real life--private life--than standard, formal history. . . . One of the lessons that we have learned--or are beginning to learn--from the study of folklore is the importance of food and eating customs in unravelling the history of a people. . . .<br><br> Eats may provide as much information about the way we live and see the world as the people we elect to office or the houses we build or the books we approve or the movies we film. . . . The foods we eat, the way we eat them, and the imagination we bestow upon their preparation will tell [much about us] to historians, folklorists, and anthropologists." --James Ward Lee, from the foreword</p><p>Texas sweet potatoes, like other native products, are "higher, longer, deeper, wider, taller, and bigger," claims a source in this amusing compilation of reminiscences, interviews, songs, family "receets" and Texas culinary customs past and present. "Do walk barefooted between corn rows if you are pregnant. It helps the woman and also the corn," advises an anonymous sage, and "Texas caviar"--"a mess of peas"--is recommended as fare for New Year's Day. We learn Frank Dobie's recipe for venison steak; how meals were cooked from a chuck wagon (for "a bunch of unruly, and often unappreciative, cowpokes"); and the definition of a stretchberry, "used by children to make their chewing gum bubble." Organized in two parts, the book first discusses Texas cooking by region, then the state's various seasonal celebrations (such as Juneteenth, marking the emancipation on June 19, 1865, of over 200,000 Texas slaves). Linck, a retired professor of English at the University of Texas at Arlington, and Roach ( The Cowgirls ) document their sources carefully and intersperse more than 150 recipes with their commentary.

Singularly susceptible to Celtic romance and history, H. V. Morton goes in search of Wales, and finds equal delight in climbing Snowdon (inclement weather aside) and going down a coal mine. Bustling with intriguing local stories and characters, Morton&#39;s fascinating account reaches from the scenic grandeur of the north to the domestic beauty of the industrial south. In the Vale of Clwyd it rains &#34;with grim enthusiasm,&#34; while at the Eisteddfod in Bangor, he is &#34;slightly worried by the trousers of bard and druid, which are visible for a few inches below their gowns.

Since its original publication 100 years ago, it has enjoyed a timeless popularity among Japanese readers both young and old, making it, according to Donald Keene, probably the most widely read novel in modern Japan.<br><br>The setting is Japan's deep south, where the author himself spent four years teaching English in a middle school. Into this conservative world, with its social proprieties and established pecking order, breezes Botchan, down from the big city, with scant respect for either his elders or his noisy young charges; and the result is a chain of collisions large and small. <br><br> Most of the story seems to occur in summer, against the drone of cicadas and the sting of mosquitoes. And in every way this is a summer book--light, sunny, and fun to read. Here, in a lively new translation much better suited to the American reader, <em>Botchan</em> should continue to entertain even those who have never been near the sunlit island on which these calamitous episodes take place.</p><p>One of Japan's most popular novels, this timeless tale of a changing society combines old idealism with modern independence. Written in 1906 and loosely based on the author's life, it recounts the experiences of a teacher who moves from Tokyo to an isolated town. Botchan&#x2014;rash and impulsive in his actions, direct and frank in his speech&#x2014;is an especially popular figure with young readers, although the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> noted,<i> </i>"This rollicking rebel, and the spice and pace of the narrative, will appeal to parent, teacher, and schoolchild alike."

Now Bear continues his provocative tale of the human race confronted by an uncertain future, where &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d; takes on astonishing and controversial new dimensions.<br><br><b>DARWIN&#x2019;S CHILDREN<br><br></b>Eleven years have passed since SHEVA, an ancient retrovirus, was discovered in human DNA&#x2014;a retrovirus that caused mutations in the human genome and heralded the arrival of a new wave of genetically enhanced humans. Now these changed children have reached adolescence . . . and face a world that is outraged about their very existence. For these special youths, possessed of remarkable, advanced traits that mark a major turning point in human development, are also ticking time bombs harboring hosts of viruses that could exterminate the &#x201c;old&#x201d; human race. <br><br>Fear and hatred of the virus children have made them a persecuted underclass, quarantined by the government in special &#x201c;schools,&#x201d; targeted by federally sanctioned bounty hunters, and demonized by hysterical segments of the population. But pockets of resistance have sprung up among those opposed to treating the children like dangerous diseases&#x2014;and who fear the worst if the government&#x2019;s draconian measures are carried to their extreme.<br><br>Scientists Kaye Lang and Mitch Rafelson are part of this small but determined minority. Once at the forefront of the discovery and study of the SHEVA outbreak, they now live as virtual exiles in the Virginia suburbs with their daughter, Stella&#x2014;a bright, inquisitive virus child who is quickly maturing, straining to break free of the protective world her parents have built around her, and eager to seek out others of her kind.<br><br>But for all their precautions, Kaye, Mitch, and Stella have not slipped below the government&#x2019;s radar. The agencies fanatically devoted to segregating and controlling the new-breed children monitor their every move&#x2014;watching and waiting for the opportunity to strike the next blow in their escalating war to preserve &#x201c;humankind&#x201d; at any cost.</p><p><i>Darwin's Children</i>, Greg Bear's follow-up to <i>Darwin's Radio</i>, is top-shelf science fiction, thrilling and intellectually charged. It's no standalone, though. The plot and characters are certainly independent of the previous novel, but the background in <i>Darwin's Radio</i> is essential to nonbiologists trying to understand what's going on. The next stage of human evolution has arrived, announced by the birth of bizarre "virus children." Now the children with the hypersenses and odd faces are growing up, and the world has to figure out what to do with them. The answer is evil and all too human, as governments put the kids in camps to protect regular folks from imagined dangers. Mitch and Kaye, scientists whose daughter Stella is swept up in the fray, become unwillingly involved in the politics that erupt around the issue of the new humans. Harrowing chases, gun battles, epidemics, and tense meetings about civil rights ensue, all brilliantly narrated. But just when you think you've got the book figured out, Bear throws a massive curveball by introducing... religion. That's right, a good old-fashioned epiphany, plopped down in the middle of a hard science fiction novel. But even skeptical readers will be swept along with Kaye as she tries to deal with what's happening to her and how it relates to the fate of her daughter's species. Keep reading past the words that make you uncomfortable--the hot science, the cool spirituality--and you'll be rewarded with a story of complete and moving humanity. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Greg Bear</b> is the author of more than twenty-five books, which have been translated into seventeen languages.

She has received lifetime achievement awards in both science fiction and fantasy, the most prestigious honors in her field.

None of the troika has ever told a bad story on her own, and they do not when collaborating. The only possible caveats are that the three writers blend so well that this is not the book to start an acquaintance with any one of them individually and that the plot is so stock that some may find it lacking in interest. Interest will not, however, be lacking in any book with these three mighty fantasists' names on the cover. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, &amp; Practice: an Extension of the Principles of A Course in Miracles</h2><p>Psychotherapy is the only form of therapy there is.

While lamenting that many Americans limit native food to hot dogs, hamburgers and barbecue, she seeks a remedy in regionalism, supplying more than 200 recipes from 18 states and geographical areas. The food is as basic as mashed potatoes and as special as conch salad, bolichi (Puerto Rican pot roast), "she-crab soup," avocado ice cream, and catfish pate with crawfish tails. Along with recipes, Bronz offers homespun but sharp-witted commentaries. On Shaker-style sauteed apples with honey and cream: "This dessert is dead simple and simply good, and typical of deceptive Shaker simplicity." On Shaker-style Ohio lemon pie: "The sharpness of lemon curd pales in comparison with this intense lemon dessert. The Shakers were celibate, but unabating in their intensity."

America&#39;s great underdog story from New York Times bestselling author Charles Cerami. Seven years after the revolution, America was in crisis. The government didn&#39;t work, but the citizens didn&#39;t care-or were in a state of rebellion. Then two unknown men, Hamilton and Madison (unknown especially compared to the revered Founding Fathers), envisioned a plan that no one else thought could happen: a truly United States. Against all odds, these men maneuvered and strategized to get the right men to agree on the right ideas. The result: the most brilliant political document ever and a powerful United States.A history of the making of the Constitution focuses on Madison and Hamilton&#39;s dynamic leadership contributions to the effort to construct a national government.</p><p>Charles Cerami is the author of the New York Times extended bestseller, Jefferson&#39;s Great Gamble (Sourcebooks, 2003), which tells the story of Jefferson, Napoleon and the Louisiana Purchase. He is also the author of Benjamin Banneker: Surveyor, Astronomer, Publisher, Patriot, among others. Cerami lives in Washington, DC.This engaging if shallow history of the making of the Constitution salutes Madison and Hamilton as the leaders of a coterie of dynamic young men battling a sclerotic old guard to construct a vigorous national government. This interpretation is not quite borne out in the text. Hamilton played a secondary role, and the new Constitution was actually championed by such pillars of the old guard as George Washington, on whom the author lavishes much adulation. And there's the question of whether Madison's crafting of the Constitution, an undoubtedly masterful political balancing act, was quite the work of visionary genius the author considers it. Historian Cerami, author of the excellent <i>Jefferson's Great Gamble,</i> gives an astute rundown of the political antagonisms and compromises embedded in the Constitution, noting its accommodations to slavery, its uneasy truce between state and federal power, and the backwardness of an independent presidency in comparison with British-style parliamentary supremacy. But he avoids the kind of deeper critiques of the Constitution made by Dan Lazare and others who view its mechanisms as antiquated. With Cerami's reverence toward the "sacred relic," this book falls short of a trenchant analysis. .<i> (July 5)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This popular phrase captures the essence of Father Jean-Pierre de Caussade&#39;s 18th century treatise on trust, Abandonment to Divine Providence. Do you doubt? Do you suffer? Are you anxious about the trials of life? Father de Caussade offers the one sure solution to any spiritual difficulty: abandon yourself entirely to God by embracing the duties of your station in life. With wisdom and gentleness he teaches how to practice complete submission to the will of God in every situation, whether we are beginners or seasoned travelers on the way of perfection. True abandonment, he explains, is a trusting, peaceful, and childlike surrender to the guidance of grace. We do not have to understand what is happening we simply have to believe that God is in control and orders all things to our good. What comes of this complete dependence on God s provision? Only perfect peace, perfect freedom, and perfect love.</p><p>For more than 250 years, this simple classic of inspiration has guided readers of all faiths to the open-hearted acceptance of God&#39;s will that is the sure path to serenity, happiness, and spiritual peace.Jean Pierre de Caussade (1675-1751) was a French Jesuit priest and writer known for his work Abandonment to Divine Providence (also translated as The Sacrament of the Present Moment) and his posthumously-published letters of instruction to the Nuns of the Visitation at Nancy, where he was spiritual director from 1733-1740, although he continued to write the sisters after leaving Nancy. While he is best known for his work with the sisters, he also spent years as preacher in southern and central France, as a college rector (at Perpignan and at Albi), and as the director of theological students at the Jesuit house in Toulouse. Caussade is remembered for, among other things, his belief that the present moment is a sacrament from God and that self-abandonment to it and its needs is a holy state - a belief which, at first glance, would appear to be heretical relative to Catholic dogma. In fact, because of this fear (especially with the Church&#39;s condemnation of the Quietist movement), Caussade&#39;s instructions to the sisters were kept unpublished until 1861, and even then they were edited (by fellow Jesuit Henri Rami�re) to protect them from charges of Quietism. A more authoritative version of these notes was published only in 1966. It is clear in his writings that he is aware of the Quietists and that he rejects their perspective. Writers such as Alan Watts have found in Caussade an Occidental, Christian-theological analogue to the Eastern religion of Mahayana Buddhism, particularly Zen Buddhism.</p><h2>Central Park in the Dark: More Mysteries of Urban Wildlife</h2><p><br><b><br>Love and loss, life and death, among the nighttime creatures of the city that never sleeps<br></b><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Like her bestseller <i>Red-Tails in Love</i>, Marie Winn&#x2019;s <i>Central Park in the Dark </i>explores a once-hidden world in a series of interlocking narratives about the extraordinary denizens, human and animal, of an iconic American park. Her beguiling account of a city&#x2019;s lakes and woodlands at night takes the reader through the cycle of seasons as experienced by nocturnal active beasts (raccoons, bats, black skimmers, and sleeping robins among them), insects (moths, wasps, fireflies, crickets), and slugs (in all their unexpected poetical randiness). Winn does not neglect her famous protagonists Pale Male and Lola, the hawks that captivated readers years ago, but this time she adds an exciting narrative about thirty-eight screech owls in Central Park and their lives, loves, and tragedies there. <p></p>An eye-popping amount of natural history is packed into this entertaining book&#x2014;on bird physiology, spiders, sunsets, dragonflies, meteor showers, and the nature of darkness. But the human drama is never forgotten, for Central Park at night boasts a floating population not only of lovers, dog walkers, and policemen but of regulars young and old who, like Winn, hope to unlock the secrets of urban nature. These &#x201c;night people&#x201d; are drawn into a peculiar kind of intimacy. While exploring the astonishing variety of wildlife in the city park, they end up revealing more of their inner lives than they expected.<br></p><p><br><b>Marie Winn</b> is the author of <i>Red-Tails in&nbsp;Love: Pale Male's Story</i>; <i>The Plug-In Drug: Televisions, Computers, and Family Life</i>; and many other books.&nbsp;She was born in Prague,&nbsp;but has spent most of her life in New York City, where she&nbsp;lives not far from Central Park.<br>Central Park in the Dark<br>1PARTY-CRASHERS AND FLYING MAMMALSThe Loeb Boathouse, located at 74th Street along Central Park's East Drive, is a popular place for parties--you have to book the space months or, for certain holidays, years in advance. Though a shuttle bus is available at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 72nd Street to take infirm or three-inch-high-heeled or merely nervous-Nelly partygoers to the Boathouse at night, some still choose to go by foot. It's a short and romantic stroll along the well-lit drive, with Pilgrim Hill and the model-boat pond visible to the east and glimpses of the rowboat lake to the west.On most balmy summer evenings these strollers might notice an odd sight--a small band of men, women, and sometimes a few children shining flashlights into a scraggly tree on the drive's east side, just past the point where the 72nd Street transverse goes straight ahead and the drive curves to the north. Indeed, on most summer nights you'll find me there too. Few stop to ask us what we're doing, perhaps because New Yorkers are trained to mind their own business. But the question hangs in the air. The answer: we're watching large, beautiful moths arriving to feed on a special tree.On a certain summer night a few years ago, just a little after sunset, I happened to be one of those gussied-up partygoers myself.Though it was hard to walk right by the gang at the Moth Tree, I couldn't miss this particular bash. It was being held in honor of a romantic couple close to my heart: Pale Male and Lola, the red-tailed hawks that had been nesting on the twelfth floor of a nearby Fifth Avenue apartment house for more than a decade.My attachment to Pale Male began in the early 1990s, when red-tailed hawks were rare in big cities. Though hawks passed over Central Park every year during the spring and fall migrations, none had ever nested there. When a light-colored redtail settled in as a year-round resident, hooked up with a mate, and then proceeded to build a nest on an elegant limestone building at Fifth Avenue and 74th Street, it was a newsworthy event. That year I wrote the first of a series of articles about Pale Male in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and I continued to cover the redtail beat for years.Pale Male, the first avian superstar. Pale Male, the red-tailed hawk that tour guides pointed out as he made lazy circles above the model-boat pond. Pale Male--the very name was a crucial ingredient in creating this hawk's celebrity. It fell trippingly from the tongue. Even the echo of Pall Mall--pronounced either as Americans do, to rhyme with <i>ball</i>, or as the upper-class British do, <i>Pell Mell</i>--gave the name a special zing. People liked to say it--Pale Male. Pale Male and Lola, his third and probably last true love. The names could pull the emotion lever all by themselves.Over the years twenty-three redtail chicks had hatched and fledged from the Fifth Avenue nest. Later, when this same species of hawk began to proliferate in New York City and other urban centers in the Northeast, Central Park's dedicated hawkwatchers began to half believe that all the other city redtails nesting on buildings and ledges were Pale Male's offspring: the Pale Male dynasty.Early one rainy morning in December, just as the twice-widowed hawk patriarch and Lola were preparing for a newbreeding season, the hawks' huge messy nest was summarily removed from its twelfth-floor ledge by workers ascending on a window-washers' platform. The building's fastidious owners had deemed the accumulation of sticks an unsightly mess and consigned it to the garbage bin.The ensuing public furor, with crowds parading outside the building chanting, "Bring back the nest!" and car horns honking on Fifth Avenue in support of Hawks' Rights, inspired newspaper headlines and television news stories around the world. Intense public attention was brought to bear on the building's residents, who became public pariahs, while the Fifth Avenue hawks won the city's sympathy and even love. The building's board of directors swiftly relented, and New York City Audubon, the city's leading bird conservation group, helped broker a deal that would allow the hawks to rebuild their nest, or at least to try. In celebration of their success and--why not?--to raise some much-needed funds, the worthy organization was throwing a party at the Boathouse, smack in the heart of Pale Male's territory.Among the bird-loving guests at the party were three who not only loved birds but loved to eat them. They were raccoons. Thick-tailed members of the Procyonidae family, close relatives of kinkajous, coatis, cacomistles, ringtails, and olingos, raccoons are far from uncommon in Central Park. Some park officials suggest that up to fifty of the black-masked mammals are permanent, year-round residents, and their real population may be twice as high.Appearing in the bushes behind the Boathouse's outdoor terrace at about 9:45 p.m., the three rather underdressed party-crashers consumed large quantities of chicken and pasta furtively offered them by a few of the invited guests. The raccoons ate noisily, but their benefactors managed to close the terrace doors. Thus they kept the animals' little growls of bestial contentment from disturbing the benefit's co-honorees, Mary Tyler Moore and Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe. Togetherwith the local Audubon chapter each had helped to resolve the nest-removal crisis. Indeed, Mary Tyler Moore was a resident of the Hawk Building at the time and a vital liaison between the bird lovers and the building's board. Her prepared remarks were being delivered just as the raccoons began feasting.Five years earlier, more than twenty-five raccoons had been found dead in the northern part of the park. Necropsies revealed multiple lacerations and puncture wounds, probably inflicted by dogs. There were rumors that two large, muscular canines, possibly Rottweilers or Doberman pinschers, had been seen ranging through the northern end of the park. Once, the rumors continued, the dogs had been seen running out of the park and into a waiting car, suggesting that the vicious pair had been loosed in the park to kill for their sadistic owner's amusement. It was a bizarre scenario.Perhaps the killers were simply feral dogs who belonged to no one. But no stray dog was deemed capable of winning a fight with a strong, aggressive fifteen- or twenty-pound raccoon. Raccoons are known to defend themselves savagely when attacked. They pose no danger to people, however--there has never been a case of a human attacked by a raccoon in Central Park. It's as unlikely an event as a squirrel biting the hand that feeds, and feeds and feeds, it. Fortunately, the dog attacks ceased as mysteriously as they started, and the park's raccoon population seemed to return to its normal number, whatever that might be.Though they are classified as nocturnal mammals, raccoons are often seen by day in Central Park. Tourists in particular are charmed to come across a wild woodland creature in the park--it's a little nature experience in the heart of the city. Birdwatchers too enjoy raccoon encounters, especially on days when birds are "quiet"--that is, nowhere to be seen. Scanning the trees with binoculars, the park's birders often come upon a raccoon sleeping at the entrance to one of its dens--they have many--or sprawled out on a horizontal branch with its legs and tail dangling.Sightings are less common in winter; though raccoons don't actually hibernate, they go into an energy-conserving winter sleep during the cold-weather months, living off stored fat reserves. Even then they'll emerge on sunny, warmish days for an evening stroll. By ones or twos, and sometimes by nines or tens, they'll venture forth at dusk to harvest the treasure trove of discarded hot dogs, pretzels, half-eaten sandwiches, apple cores, and other goodies available in every garbage can.The three raccoons who attended the benefit at the Boathouse seemed to like the chocolate petits fours and the miniature cheesecakes from the dessert table above all. They picked up each little pastry with their hands and delicately placed it in their mouths, a behavior that a widely used text describes as characteristic of the species--the manual dexterity, that is, not the consumption of baked goods."<i>Procyon</i> has a well-developed sense of touch ... the hands are regularly used almost as skillfully as monkeys use theirs," say the authors of <i>Walker's Mammals of the World</i> (none of them, oddly enough, named Walker), adding an observation that seriously undermines the raccoon's scientific name, <i>Procyon lotor</i> ("washing bear"): "Although raccoons have sometimes been observed to dip food in water, especially under captive conditions, the legend that they actually wash their food is without foundation."The raccoon's versatile hands (actually the front feet) are a useful adaptation that allows these highly successful animals to reach into small spaces or turn over stones while looking for prey, as well as to catch and hold on to small animals, fish, and a variety of invertebrates. They enable raccoons to perform the single act for which they are most famous (or infamous) in the human community: opening garbage cans, no matter how securely closed. Raccoons don't have to exert themselves much in Central Park--many of the garbage cans have no lids at all. The nimble animals just climb in and carry off their booty to eat innearby trees. Sometimes a couple of animals will work in concert to knock over a large garbage can. Then they can dine on the spot. They just crawl in and chow down.At the Boathouse Pale Male shindig, the three raccoons didn't have to lift a finger. But after the bandit-masked, ring-tailed, pointy-muzzled omnivores had eaten a truly awesome number of rich little confections, some partygoers became concerned for their health. These fears were groundless. Raccoons show up regularly at private Boathouse functions and employees reported that the three were seen again the evening after the Audubon benefit. They were in fine fettle, the men reported, though they seemed a little peckish, if not downright hungry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There are many more bats than raccoons to be found in Central Park, but the flying mammals' more reclusive hunting habits usually keep them out of human sight. That may be a good thing, since many people are deeply--and needlessly--terrified of bats. Late strollers in the park may glimpse the dark shapes of hunting bats circling over one or another of the park's bodies of water, but unthinkingly they assume the creatures are birds. Being crepuscular--active at dusk and at dawn--as well as nocturnal, bats are rarely seen by Central Park visitors in broad daylight. <i>Rarely</i>, however, does not mean <i>never</i>.One of these rare daytime bat encounters was enjoyed by Kellye Rosenheim, a fairly recent addition to Central Park's roster of expert birders. A pretty and stylish young woman, Kellye had been a beginner ten years earlier when she'd gone on one of Wendy Paulson's Nature Conservancy bird walks in Central Park. She just wanted a few hours away from the kids. But those few hours changed her life.Once bitten by the birding bug, a gifted person can moveahead quickly. Kellye advanced at breakneck speed. She went on bird walks. She went on birding trips. She studied bird books and field guides and tapes of birdsong. Today she leads the Nature Conservancy1 walks in Central Park whenever Wendy is in Washington. This happened frequently after her husband, Henry Paulson, was appointed secretary of the treasury in June 2006.One late October morning Kellye had a serendipitous encounter with a red bat in the Ramble and sent me a detailed note about it. When I compared some of her observations with scientific accounts of the same species, I appreciated the precision of her description. That ability to observe carefully and remember tiny details, even ones that might seem insignificant, is the sign of unusual talent.Picture this: 8:30 a.m., Sunday, October 22, a little chilly. A friend and I walked up the hill from the Boathouse and turned toward the Point, where that little path begins. Just where a low railing on the right begins, we stepped out onto the rock cliff there. You know the spot, it's where most birdwatchers begin their watching. Looking down, you see the swampy area below.As you're standing there, if you look out at eye level, you see the willows on the left. But straight ahead there's a tree--it has oval leaves, pointed at the end, about four inches long, which hang down vertically from the twig branches they grow on. They grow in a line down the branch.Well, we were watching a cardinal moving around on that tree. All of a sudden something hissed at the bird and I thought it was a snake coming out of the leaves to strike at it. But I put my binoculars on it and saw it was a bat, with its side to me. The "snake's body" that I thought I saw was its wing extended out.I could see its face. Its little mouth was open with the teethshowing. It was hanging upside down, not, I believe, from the branch, but clinging to a big leaf, kind of hiding behind it. The fur was red all over its body (about four inches long) and the skin on its wing was black except where the bones underneath were--there it was reddish, like its fur. That's how I figured it was a Red Bat. It was just awesome. Eventually it retracted its wing and went back into hiding, but not before a hermit thrush dove at it as it would at an owl.The bat was hanging on to the leaf of that tree near its stem, or so it appeared. I should mention that the leaves on its tree were all still green. The bat itself was at eye level, if you're standing on the cliff there. It looked kind of like a dead leaf behind some green leaves.The image of a bat looking like a dead leaf in the midst of a cluster of green ones jogged my memory. I looked in a file folder of references to bats in Central Park and there I found what I was looking for: an article in the August 1956 issue of the <i>Journal of Mammalogy</i> entitled "Migration Records of the Red Bat," by the late ornithologist John K. Terres. He wrote:On September 1, 1955, I caught a live female red bat with my hands that I saw hanging from the branch of a wild black cherry tree in Central Park, New York City. The bat was only about eight feet above the ground, and bore a striking resemblance to a dead brown leaf. It hung from a twig among a cluster of green leaves, and was asleep when I caught it. I examined it for ectoparasites but found none. I returned it to its perch by putting its feet to the twig, which it clutched, and after a momentary shuffling of its wings, seemed to go back to sleep. When I came back to look for it the next day it was gone.As I reread the old clipping, an odd question struck me: How had John Terres managed to reach a bat hanging eight feetabove the ground? I called an old friend who'd worked with the noted bird expert on his magnum opus, <i>The Audubon Society's Encyclopedia of North American Birds</i>, and asked: "Was John Terres an exceptionally tall man?" "No," she answered, "he wasn't particularly tall. Sort of average height." How had he nabbed his bat, then? I wondered. Had he climbed the tree?A week later I visited the spot Kellye had described, the rocky cliff looking down on a swampy area Central Park's birders call, for unknown reasons, the Oven. It's a favorite birdwatching location, especially during the spring migration, and for a simple reason: ...</p><h2>Send Yourself Roses: Thoughts on My Life, Love, and Leading Roles</h2><p>From her film debut as the sultry schemer in <em>Body Heat</em> to her award-winning role as Martha in <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em>, actress Kathleen Turner's unique blend of beauty, intelligence, and raw sexuality has driven her personal and professional life. Now, in this gutsy memoir, the screen icon tells us of the risks she's taken and the lessons she's learned-sometimes the hard way.<br> For the first time, Turner shares her childhood challenges-a life lived in countries around the world until her father, a State Department official whom she so admired, died suddenly when she was a teenager. She talks about her twenty year marriage, and why she and her husband recently separated, her close relationship with her daughter, her commitment to service, and how activism in controversial causes has bolstered her beliefs. And Turner reveals the pain and heartbreak of her struggle with rheumatoid arthritis, and how, in spite of it, she made a daring decision: to take a break from the movies and relaunch her stage career.<br> Along the way, Turner describes what it's like to work with legends like Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, William Hurt, Steve Martin, Francis Ford Coppola, John Huston, John Waters, Edward Albee...and, with characteristic irreverent humor, shares her behind-the-screen stories of dealing with all types of creative, intimidating, and inspiring characters.<br> Kathleen Turner has always known that she would play the lead in the story of her life. It's impossible not to take her lessons on living, love, and leading roles to heart. And it won't be long until you'll be sending <em>yourself</em> roses!</p><p><strong>Kathleen Turner</strong> is an award-winning actress who has starred in over twenty-five films including <em>Prizzi's Honor</em>, <em>Romancing the St</em>one, and <em>The War of the Roses</em>, along with twelve Broadway shows including <em>The Graduate</em> and <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em>.

Now Turner, with the aid of Gloria Feldt, bares her heart to readers in an upbeat account of her life and work. Turner discovered the theater when she was a teenager living with her Foreign Service family in London; from then on, she took every opportunity to study acting and to perform. Eventually, she landed the steamy lead in <i>Body Heat</i>. Playing such a sexually voracious female role might have typecast her, so she followed it with a comedy, <i>The Man with Two Brains</i>. As she discusses the other acting roles she's chosen, she's emphatic that the selection of material and characters I play reflects my values. She's also been deliberate in her offstage life&#x2014;her decision to marry, to have a child and to divorce. With great candor, she details some of her worst struggles, battling both rheumatoid arthritis and alcohol. In the end, she's realized it comes down to taking the lead role in her own life. While she may indulge in swear words a bit much for some readers, Turner's vision of life's many possibilities&#x2014;even as she gets older&#x2014;is surely inspiring. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>The Namesake</i>, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations.<br><i>The Namesake</i> takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged marriage, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. <br>Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along a first-generation path strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.</p><p>Any talk of <i>The Namesake</i>--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut, <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i>--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks. <p> Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship. His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: "At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind." Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no cleverness or showing-off in <i>The Namesake</i>, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>THE NAMESAKE follows the Ganguli family through its journey from Calcutta to Cambridge to the Boston suburbs. Ashima and Ashoke Ganguli arrive in America at the end of the 1960s, shortly after their arranged marriage in Calcutta, in order for Ashoke to finish his engineering degree at MIT. Ashoke is forward-thinking, ready to enter into American culture if not fully at least with an open mind. His young bride is far less malleable. Isolated, desperately missing her large family back in India, she will never be at peace with this new world.<br><br>Soon after they arrive in Cambridge, their first child is born, a boy. According to Indian custom, the child will be given two names: an official name, to be bestowed by the great-grandmother, and a pet name to be used only by family. But the letter from India with the child's official name never arrives, and so the baby's parents decide on a pet name to use for the time being. Ashoke chooses a name that has particular significance for him: on a train trip back in India several years earlier, he had been reading a short story collection by one of his most beloved Russian writers, Nikolai Gogol, when the train derailed in the middle of the night, killing almost all the sleeping passengers onboard. Ashoke had stayed awake to read his Gogol, and he believes the book saved his life. His child will be known, then, as Gogol.<br><br>Lahiri brings her enormous powers of description to her first novel, infusing scene after scene with profound emotional depth.

A full-time writer since 1980, he has written over forty books and won prizes for individual novels (including the Crime Writers' Association's prestigious Gold Dagger Award for Best Crime Novel of the Year for <i>Bones and Silence</i>) and for short stories. In 1995 he was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger for his lifetime contribution to crime-writing. He spent many years as a teacher in Yorkshire which provided the inspiration and setting for the novels featuring the Falstaffian figure of Andy Dalziel, Head of Mid-Yorkshire CID, and his more sensitive sidekick, Peter Pascoe, whose adventures in the detective trade have been the basis of one of the most satisfying novel sequences of the modem age.

Although the Manhattan Project is now well known, Dan Kurzman chronicles an obscure yet vitally important episode that helped deny the Nazi's the A-bomb. <p> Soon after the Germans invaded Norway in April of 1940, they began using the Norsk Hydro electrochemical and hydroelectric plant to produce deuterium oxide--"heavy water"--a principal element needed to create atomic weapons. <i>Blood and Water: Sabotaging Hitler's Bomb</i> follows the two-year clandestine mission conducted by the British and Norwegian commandos who braved rugged, high-mountain terrain to defuse a situation that could have changed the course of the war. This is a textbook case of fact being more exciting than fiction; the story has the pace and feel of a well-orchestrated thriller. Based on interviews with the Norwegian and British saboteurs, war diaries, and recently declassified documents, Kurzman's book brings history alive, revealing the real men behind this heroic chapter of the Allies' victory.</p>In history that reads like a great thriller, award-winning former Washington Post reporter Kurzman (Left to Die: The Tragedy of the USS Juneau, 1994, etc.) tells the story of the Allied effort to derail the Nazi quest to develop a nuclear bomb. In the war's early stages, Kurzman relates, Nazi Germany's atomic research program, which included many of the world's greatest physicists, was more advanced than those of the Allies. However, the German effort was crippled by a dependence on heavy water to facilitate a chain reaction. For a long time Norsk Hydro in Norway, a factory seized by the Germans, was the only producer of heavy water in the Third Reich. At the urging of General Leslie Groves, the military leader of the Manhattan Project, the plant quickly became the target of British commando raids and American bombing attacks. Several of the commando raids failed, and Kurzman's account brings out the heroism of the English and Norwegian raiders who fell victim to Hitler's standing order to execute all captured commandos. In a night attack in February 1943, Norwegian raiders in British uniforms finally succeeded in penetrating the plant and setting off a destructive explosion within the factory. However, because of the danger that the Germans would simply rebuild the productive portions of the plant, American bombers attacked in November 1943 and severely damaged the factory, killing 28 Norwegian civilians. This still did not finish the threat posed by the heavy-water program at Norsk Hydro, however: When the Nazis attempted to move heavy-water stocks from Norway, saboteurs destroyed a ferry bearing the cargo, killing 26 civilians in the process. Kurzman quotes OSS official (and later CIA chief) William Casey as estimating that at war's end the Germans were 700 liters of heavy water short of developing an effective nuclear reaction.

In fact, few of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence and drafted the U.S. Constitution had ever seen a public school, and yet they benefited from a free system of education vastly superior to the imagined benefits of today&#39;s state-controlled schooling. What happened over the course of the last and a half centuries? Why did Americans surrender the educational freedom that produced such widespread academic excellence to embrace a state of functional illiteracy under complete government control? In his seminal book Is Public Education Necessary?, Samuel Blumenfeld unpacks two centuries of source material to present an accurate history of the religious and philosophical transformations that gave birth to the educational statism controlling America&#39;s children today. From the New England Puritan experiments in compulsory schooling to the Unitarian crusades to perfect man with the &#34;strong arm of government&#34;, Blumenfeld shows that public education in America has always been more about religion than literacy. A colorful history full of fascinating characters and incisive commentary, Is Public Education Necessary? challenges American parents to discard the common wisdom concerning public schools to reshoulder the responsibilities that are rightfully theirs, to fight to keep the liberties they inherited, and to teach their children to do the same.</p><p>About the author: Samuel L. Blumenfeld is the author of nine books on education, including How to Tutor (1978), NEA:Trojan Horse in American Education (1984), The Victims of Dick &amp; Jane and Other Essays (2003), and Revolution via Education (2009).

This is not to say, however, that it is by any means quiet on the Row, a place where bathtubs double as lawn furniture, and adultery, bribery and larceny are as commonplace as the glass eyeballs that pop up in every yard -- all that remains from the prosthetics mill that once sat on this land. For more than thirty years, the Row&#39;s antiques dealers have run their businesses from the front rooms of their aging shotgun-style houses. After all this time, their lives have become inextricably linked -- and undeniably complicated. It is suddenly clear that there&#39;s more to be exposed on the Row than buried body parts: it seems everyone has something to hide -- from their customers, their spouses, even themselves. And they feel they&#39;re being watched....They are. The seventy-two-year-old widow Effie keeps a minute-by-minute journal of her neighbors&#39; activities, following even stray dogs from house to house, peeking, staring and spying, sure they are all out to steal her past, ruin her future, and plunder her &#34;better things.&#34; The fact is, Row residents have far more to concern them than old Effie. Carl, behind curtains he never opens, is using his considerable woodworking talents to turn his life -- and his house -- inside out to prove his devotion to the vintage-clothing dealer Nadine. Howard Dog-in-His-Path, a grave-robbing Indian, keeps count of every pet buried in his neighbors&#39; backyards. The Postlethwaites, running from a tragic past, have retired to long days at the mall photo shop, where they watch pictures of other people&#39;s lives roll off the developing machines. Mose, an aged inventor, is trying his hand at the ultimate invention: true love. Mazelle, a used-book dealer, has given up reading because the secret life she lives in the cistern beneath her husband&#39;s garden is far more interesting than any fiction. The dog Himself has no greater secret than the location of his next meal, but what he digs up may reveal more than his fellow Row residents would like. From the quirky to the certifiable, folks on the Row have definitely gotten their lines crossed. When a violent storm strikes, causing fire, a heart attack and grand theft, it stirs up more than just the earth it hits. Suddenly, long-buried truths are flowing faster than the flooding rains. When the dust and smoke finally clear, the Row has been turned upside down and nobody -- human or dog -- will ever be the same again. With a strong, rich and uproariously funny voice, Joe Coomer resurrects the magic of his previous novels, Beachcombing for a Shipwrecked God and The Loop, and turns the utterly ordinary into the stunningly extraordinary. With a splendid cast of characters and the cleverest canine in comedy, Apologizing to Dogs is a hilarious, heartwarming and wonderfully human tale and proves that no matter how old you get, there&#39;s always something worth holding on to, fighting for and loving with all your might.</p><p>About the last thing you'd expect to find on a street arrayed with a dozen antique shops is something novel. Yet Worth Row, the setting for Joe Coomer's eighth book, <i>Apologizing to Dogs</i>, is fairly brimming with surprise and revelation. Romance, thievery, blackmail, and more all come to light on one bewildering day in Fort Worth's historic antique district. By the time the dust has settled, Coomer's quirky cadre of shop owners find their fragile equanimity forever shattered.<p> Slowly and surely losing patrons to the nearby mall, the Row is presided over by the prim and sentimental clothes dealer Nadine, who is the object of carpenter Carl's desire. His other passion, it turns out, is gutting his house to build the ship that he hopes will ferry Nadine and him to a new life. Meanwhile, Carl's neighbor, the recalcitrant Howard Dog-in-His-Path, conceals a bevy of confidences while loafing in his front-yard tub; the reclusive, paranoid Effie peers through her shutters and transcribes up-to-the-minute neighborhood reports in her journal; and, across the street, Tradio and Arthur are caught between the need to reveal they're lovers and the desire to keep the Row's boat from rocking. Just up the street are Mr. and Mrs. Haygood, and next to them are Mazelle--of Mazelle's Rare and Medium Rare Books--and her husband. These two couples form a love-square that gets dug up, literally, by a curious dog.</p><p> Just about every bit of tangled lineage and concealed secret gets exposed in Coomer's outlandish tale. At its best, <i>Apologizing to Dogs</i> reveals the tension between nostalgia and fulfillment, as well as the overwhelming force of our attachments, material or otherwise. "Why do we save old things," Arthur asks Nadine. "Why do we collect these old precious things?" In its improbable eruptions and rambling dialogue, however, the novel occasionally sacrifices verisimilitude for reheated comedy. The paradox of selling the old in order to sustain the present keeps the novel churning along. Soak up the bittersweet laughs, but, as one character says, tellingly, "Don't try to guess the end. Try not to figure it out." <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p><b>Joe Coomer</b> is the author of <i>Beachcombing for a Shipwrecked God, The Loop, Sailing in a Spoonful of Water</i> and an award-winning book of nonfiction, <i>Dream House.</i> He lives in Azle, Texas, and Eliot, Maine.</p><h2>Restless Wind</h2><p>Rosalee Spurlock challenges the dangers of the Colorado mountains with her courage, her rifle and her heart.

Powerful traces of its ideas have been found in the ideas of such diverse people as Dante, the Troubadours, Shakespeare and Spinoza. <p>Recently, however, attention has shifted to the literary and psychological heritage of the Sufis. Idries Shah has shown, to the widespread approval of modern scholars, the affinities of Sufi sages with the sociologists, psychologists and anthropologists of today. </p><p>Based on lectures at the New School for Social Research, New York, and the University of California, San Francisco "Neglected Aspects of Sufi Study" deals with many of the problems of Sufi methods of study, especially those which militate against its effective progress in the modern world: notably the unrecognized assumptions which we make about ourselves and about learning and its processes. </p><p>In this essential book, Shah examines the psychology of his readership - our demand for cults, the consumer society, and prevailing cultural responses, East and West. </p><p>This book provides a companion to the twenty volumes of Sufi studies and literature which Shah has extracted from the literature and practice of Sufis over the past one thousand years.</p></p><p>As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of Idries Shah (1924-1996) as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking. Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language." Saturday Review </p><p>"A major psychological and cultural event of our time." Psychology Today </p><p>"One is immediately forced to use one's mind in a new way." New York Times </p><p>The instrumental function of Shah's work is now well established among people from all walks of life. Stockbrokers, scientists, lawyers, managers, writers, physicians, and diplomats have found Shah's literature for human development "extraordinary". </p><p>"It presents a blueprint of the human mental structure." Robert Ornstein, Ph.D. </p><p>"Extremely useful in teaching students about management and computers." Thomas Malone, MIT </p><p>"Idries Shah provides the unique perspective that allows us to assess real motivations and social biases in a more accurate light." E. Neilsen, Attorney at Law</p>We can look at the approach to Sufi perceptions in the light of three stages of learning. This, again, closely follows the right and wrong ways in scientific education and research, though not the pattern of the occult-esoteric attitudes with which Sufism has sometimes been confused: <p>1. ENJOYMENT: when people learn little, whatever they may imagine they are doing, since emotion fills them and becomes, as it were, something which they are consuming. People in this phase are merely amusing themselves, though they may be good citizens, depending on how they behave. This is rooted in greed. </p><p>2. EMPLOYMENT: when people try to use materials prematurely (before they have been sufficiently prepared to attain any real knowledge). This is rooted in impatience and selfishness. How much to try to use is the point here. </p><p>3. DEPLOYMENT: when the person is attuned to the extent and way in which he can serve and be served, so that the teaching is really able to take effect, to become active in and through the individual.</p></p><h2>Alec Douglas - Home</h2><p>Very Good used copy: Some light wear to cover, spine and page edges.

I was not able to put it down, and I read parts of it twice."&#x2015;<b><i>Temple Grandin, author of <em>Animals Make Us Human</em></i></b><br><br>"Enjoyed it thoroughly."&#x2015;<b><i>Jeffrey Masson, author of <em>When Elephants Weep</em></i></b><br><br>"...a remarkable book."&#x2015;<b><i>Susan Wilson, author of <em>One Good Dog </em>and <em>The Fortune Teller's Daughter</em></i></b><br><br>"A poignant read on the meaning of life and its priorities--how death and despair can lead to renewal and life, but only if one realizes the interconnectedness of all creatures."&#x2015;<b><i>Irene M. Pepperberg, author of <em>Alex and Me</em></i></b><br><br>"This moving and riveting novel beautifully expresses the transforming power of the human-animal relationship. Read it if you shared your life with an animal, but more importantly, read it if you haven't."&#x2015;<b><i>Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, and author of the bestseller <em>Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds About Animals and Food</em></i></b><br><br>"A suspenseful, heart-throbbing novel exploring the big questions of life, death, sentience, animal rights, compassion, righteous indignation, and what it is all about and why. The surprise twists are like an emotional roller coaster. Read it, weep, grab your chair, and gain insights into the big why!"&#x2015;<b><i>Allen M. Schoen, D.V.M., and author of <em>Kindred Spirits: How the Remarkable Bond Between Humans and Animals Can Change the Way We Live</em></i></b><br><br>"Humans are pretty much a big-brained, self-centered, and arrogant lot, but when we allow ourselves to connect with other animals in deep and meaningful ways, they ground us and allow us to show who we really are--compassionate, empathetic, and caring beings. In this unique and moving novel, Neil Abramson shows just how strong our relationships with other animals can be, and how we can learn so much from our animal kin about their needs, their emotions, and respect, dignity, and love. I was continually moved as I read UNSAID and reflected on its important messages about just how important other animals are to us, and encourage you to read this intriguing book and share it widely."&#x2015;<b><i>Marc Bekoff, author of <em>The Emotional Lives of Animals, Animals Matter, Wild Justice, and The Animal Manifesto: Six Reasons for Expanding Our Compassion Footprint</em></i></b><br><br>"A remarkable book, uncanny in that its narrator is recently deceased, but vivid in its development of believable and complex characters, both human and nonhuman. The author embeds in the story important aspects of current controversies over the extent of animal capacities as well as a keen sense of the value of animal lives&#x2015;<b><i>Susan J. Armstrong, Professor Emerita, Humboldt State University, and co-editor, <em>The Animal Ethics Reader</em></i></b><br><br>"Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a novel of animal slaughter and the men who perform it, exerted a powerful influence on a much earlier generation. May I hope that Neil Abramson's novel, UNSAID, will have a similar effect on present day readers and help us understand that animals need us as much as we need them.

By the author of Lion of Ireland. 100,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p><p>Since 1980 <b>Morgan Llywelyn</b> has created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, from the earliest times to the present day. her critically acclaimed novels, both of history and of mythology, have been translated into many languages. She is an Irish citizen and lives in Dublin.</p><p><strong>I</strong><br>The red stag broke cover unexpectedly. Finn and his hounds were taken by surprise. The two dogs froze, waiting for his command. He had one glimpse into huge liquid eyes, pleading eyes; then the stag bounded away down the mountain, belling a warning.<br>Light from the westering sun burnished the deer&#x2019;s russet coat. North beyond Galway Bay, thick, pale clouds sagged with the weight of approaching winter. Sleet hissed on the wind.<br>Hot with life, the stag flickered like flame across a cold grey landscape.<br>&#x201c;Red deer, red deer,&#x201c; Finn murmured, immobilized by beauty. A poem rose in him like spring water.<br>Shouts exploded behind him.<br>&#x201c;Stag, a big one!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Get it!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kill it! Kill it!&#x201d;<br>Men boiled past Finn, waving their spears and howling their hunger. His instincts briefly merged with theirs. His fingers tightened on the shaft of his spear, his muscles contracted for heft and hurl.<br>But the poem stopped him. The poem, growing in him.<br>&#x201c;Hold where you are!&#x201d; he cried. The two young hounds, Bran and Sceolaun, whined, but stood.<br>The men found it harder to obey. Momentum had already carried them past him. They were hunters and a stag was running. But they were also warriors of the <em>F�anna</em>, and he was the new leader of their particular <em>f�an</em>of nine.<br>He called himself Finn Mac Cool.<br>Planting their spears on the slope to brace themselves, the <em>f�nnidi</em>watched with regret as the deer leaped from one limestone outcropping to another. When it disappeared from sight, their eyes turned toward Finn.<br>&#x201c;You let a fine fat stag get away,&#x201c; accused Conan Maol, Conan the Hairless. &#x201c;And us starving.&#x201d;<br>Dark, slender Cailte added, &#x201c;I could have run him down and eaten the entire animal myself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You could have done,&#x201c; Finn said amiably. &#x201c;But then he&#x2019;d be gone, all that grace and beauty destroyed. And you&#x2019;d just be hungry again tomorrow. A creature that splendid can serve a better purpose surely than swelling your belly.&#x201d;<br>His men exchanged glances. They were beginning to recognize a certain cadence when it crept into the speech of their newly appointed <em>r�gf�nnid</em>. Fionn son of Cuhal was a dedicated hunter. But when the impulse to poetry seized him, everything else must wait. His band had already learned that much about him.<br>With a last wistful glance after the lost deer, they formed a circle around their leader, crossed their legs, and sat. The ground was cold. They ignored discomfort.<br>Finn remained standing. His eyes were turned northward. The jagged peaks of the Twelve Bens were dimly visible across the bay, disappearing into lowering clouds, but Finn was not looking at the mountains anyway.<br>In his mind, he was watching the red stag run.<br>His expression grew dreamy and faraway. His hair was as pale as winter sunlight, his eyes as clear as water. But when he was ready to speak, his voice would be deep and sure.<br>Bran and Sceolaun sniffed out the bed in the bracken where the deer had lain. Some of the animal&#x2019;s warmth lingered in the flattened ferns. Circling three times, the hounds remade the bed to suit themselves and curled up together. Sceolaun rested her muzzle on her crossed forepaws, but her companion&#x2019;s head was propped across her back so Bran could keep watchful eyes on Finn.<br>The cry of wild geese rang through the sky. Looking up, Finn saw black wings carving lines in silver space.<br>He nodded. The poem was complete. He recited,<br><br><em>Here&#x2019;s my tale</em>.<br><em>Stag cries, winter snarls, summer dies</em>.<br><em>High and cold the wind</em>.<br><em>Low and dull the sun, and brief its run</em>.<br><em>Strong surge the seas</em>.<br><em>In red-brown bracken, shapes lie hidden</em>.<br><em>Geese sing, fleeing south, ice on wing</em>.<br><em>That&#x2019;s my tale</em>.<br><br>When Finn stopped speaking, Donn said, &#x201c;Brrr! That&#x2019;s made me colder than I was already.&#x201d;<br>The poet smiled, flattered.<br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Winter snarls,&#x2018;&#x201d; quoted Fergus. &#x201c;A particularly nice bit, that.&#x201d; His mouth worked, savouring the words.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a grand poem entirely,&#x201c; Cailte affirmed, &#x201c;but it won&#x2019;t fill our bellies. Words are no substitute for a haunch of venison or a fine silver salmon with the smell of the sea on him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d give my good eye for some badger meat dripping grease,&#x201c; sighed the husky voice of Goll Mac Morna.<br>Lugaid suggested hopefully, &#x201c;We could still bring down that stag, the hounds could track him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Leave him be!&#x201d; Finn ordered sharply, unwilling to have the source of his inspiration slain. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find something else, we always do.&#x201d; He brandished his spear and whistled. Bran and Sceolaun jumped up and ran to him, wriggling with the exuberance of half-grown hounds. The hunt resumed.<br>Except for Goll Mac Morna, all of them were young and exuberant, brimming with barely controlled energy. They had unblunted features and blue-white eyeballs and had only recently begun growing warriors&#x2019; mustaches. They were brash and merry and thought themselves immortal.<br>Searching the slopes of Black Head, the fian poked spears into every crevice and hollow, seeking to flush out small game--hares or red squirrels, or even the half-mouthful of a pigmy shrew. They laughed and swore and shoved each other; they traded insults until the crisp air crackled.<br>Cael challenged his friend, &#x201c;If you can put one foot in front of the other, I&#x2019;ll race you to the bottom!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Done!&#x201d; cried Madan Bent-Neck, who owed his permanently cocked head carriage to a slight deformity. He wore the round shield slung across his back higher than his companions did, to conceal the uneven-ness of his shoulders.<br>Physical beauty was not required of a <em>f�nnid</em>; only strength and courage mattered in battle.<br>The two bounded away in exaggerated leaps. Goll said disapprovingly, &#x201c;Those young fools will kill themselves, running headlong on that footing.&#x201d;<br>Finn flashed a merry grin. &#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s two less we&#x2019;ll have to find game for. Think of the effort saved!&#x201d;<br>Goll chuckled. One of his eyes twinkled. The other was milky, bisected by a slashing scar that puckered cheek and brow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Conan who&#x2019;ll be the most grateful, he&#x2019;s the laziest.&#x201d;<br>But in spite of Goll&#x2019;s prediction, Cael and Madan reached the bottom without mishap. They turned and trotted back up at a more leisurely pace, watching their footing. By the time they rejoined their companions halfway up Black Head, they were breathing hard, however.<br>Cailte said scornfully, &#x201c;Neither of you knows how to run.&#x201d; He pulled his wolf-fur cloak out from under his shield and tossed it aside, revealing a body as thin as a sapling, clad in a leather kilt and a deerskin tunic. &#x201c;Mind you, this is what running is,&#x201c; he said. He raced off down the mountain, his shield bouncing against his shoulder blades.<br>In a voice like thick cream, Fergus Honey-Tongue remarked, &#x201c;Cailte Mac Ronan is faster than thought.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He makes Cael and Madan look like old women,&#x201c; said Conan.<br>Madan bristled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair to compare us to him. Cailte won the running championship at the last Tailltenn Fair.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he did,&#x201c; Finn agreed. &#x201c;Therefore he should be the standard you set for yourselves. Go and catch him, you two.&#x201d;<br>Cael&#x2019;s jaw sagged. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t serious.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am serious. And since I would never ask you to do anything I wouldn&#x2019;t do myself...&#x201d; Without pausing to take off his cloak, Finn turned and ran down the mountain after Cailte. Bran and Sceolaun frisked along beside him, barking excitedly.<br>With a whoop, Blamec set off after them. Cael and Madan felt compelled to follow. The entire band joined in, slipping and slithering down the north face of Black Head, waving their arms and their spears for balance, cursing and colliding and shouting with laughter.<br>Reaching the bottom well ahead of the others, Cailte sat down on a slab of stone and dug into the leather bag slung from a thong around his neck. He was just taking a bite of hoarded food when Finn joined him.<br>&#x201c;Want some of this?&#x201d; Cailte offered.<br>&#x201c;What is it? Och, honey fungus. I&#x2019;ll wait for meat. You&#x2019;d eat anything though, wouldn&#x2019;t you? Move over.&#x201d;<br>Cailte obligingly slid over to make room for Finn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d eat anything if I was hungry. And I&#x2019;m always hungry.&#x201d;<br>As the others arrived, Finn called out their names. &#x201c;Blamec. Lugaid the Serious. Donn. Conan the Hairless. Cael. Fergus Honey-Tongue. Madan.&#x201d; There was a long pause while they all waited. Then, &#x201c;And here at last is Goll Mac Morna.&#x201d;<br>Goll was gasping for breath and sweating profusely. He had an appalling stitch in his side. He stopped before he got to Finn and bent over with his hands braced on his knees. &#x201c;I had to bring up the rear,&#x201c; he panted. A fit of coughing ensued. When it had passed, he added, &#x201c;Someone had to guard the young ones&#x2019; backsides.&#x201d;<br>Sceolaun ran to him and began trying to lick his face. He elbowed her away but she came right back. Her tongue slopped noisily across Goll&#x2019;s mouth. He made a strangled sound of disgust. &#x201c;Finn, call off this wretched bitch!&#x201d;<br>Finn whistled. At once Sceolaun left her victim and trotted to her master, mouth agape as if laughing.<br>Goll followed, clutching his side. &#x201c;When I was the age of these young ones,&#x201c; he said raspingly, &#x201c;I was as fleet as any of them.&#x201d;<br>Finn smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your age that hampers you, Goll. It&#x2019;s your girth. You grow th...</p></p><h2>Blue Book of Guitar Amplifiers</h2><p>Looking for guitar amplifier values and information?

Yet as Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in <i>The Outsourced Self</i>, that is no longer the case: everything that was once part of private life&#x2015;love, friendship, child rearing&#x2015;is being transformed into packaged expertise to be sold back to confused, harried Americans.</p><p>Drawing on hundreds of interviews and original research, Hochschild follows the incursions of the market into every stage of intimate life. From dating services that train you to be the CEO of your love life to wedding planners who create a couple's "personal narrative"; from nameologists (who help you name your child) to wantologists (who help you name your goals); from commercial surrogate farms in India to hired mourners who will scatter your loved one's ashes in the ocean of your choice&#x2015;Hochschild reveals a world in which the most intuitive and emotional of human acts have become work for hire.</p><p>Sharp and clear-eyed, Hochschild is full of sympathy for overstressed, outsourcing Americans, even as she warns of the market's threat to the personal realm they are striving so hard to preserve.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Barbara Ehrenreich Reviews <em>The Outsourced Self</em></strong> <br> <strong>Barbara Ehrenreich is the best-selling author of <em>Nickel and Dimed</em>.</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p> It's a rare and brilliant book that helps us see ordinary life in a whole new way. Take the business of children's birthday parties. When my children were little, I'd put on their parties myself--making the cake, setting up the party games, presiding over the subsequent chaos, and cleaning up the mess. Forty years later, my daughter arranges for "professionals" to create and manage her children's parties. The nationwide chain called The Little Gym, for example, runs a 90 minute party for $225, including invitations, paper goods, and leadership by a "qualified birthday leader plus an assistant." Parents watch the whole thing from the sidelines.</p> <p>As Arlie Russell Hochschild shows, birthday parties are only one way we've "outsourced" our personal lives. We might seek on-line match-making companies to find a mate, paid relationship advisors to navigate the dating process, wedding planners if the process is successful, perhaps a surrogate mother to bear the children, then child-raising experts to advise on parenting issues--not to mention special consultants to arrange care for the older generation. In other words, that vast and impersonal entity--the market--is penetrating our most intimate relationships and managing the great turning points in our lives. Those who can afford to pay them are increasingly dependent on outside "experts," "coaches," and of course "birthday leaders."</p> <p>Is this the dystopian outcome dreaded by social scientists since the 19th century? Or is it a rational adjustment to a busy and complex world where no one has time to make their own party favors? Hochschild is definitely drawn to the old, self-reliant, ways represented by her own grandparents, but she is a sociologist, not a scold. <em>The Outsourced Self</em> goes on to explore the ways people manage to redraw the lines between public and private and maintain a modicum of autonomy. I won't say Hochschild will "make" you think: She's such a keen observer and delightful writer that she makes it fun to think. <em>--Barbara Ehrenreich</em></p><p><b>Arlie Russell Hochschild</b> is the author of <i>The Time Bind</i>, <i>The Second Shift</i>, and <i>The Managed Heart</i>.

Here are songs that young children can act out, such as "London Bridge," "Pop Goes the Weasel," and "The Mulberry Bush." There are also work songs, such as "I've Been Working on the Railroad"; ballads, like "Shenandoah"; and nursery songs, including "Oats, Peas, and Beans." The selections are drawn from popular traditions around the world; some have been enjoyed and sung for hundreds of years. Throughout the book are insightful comments on the art and the songs. All of the selections include simple arrangements for musical accompaniment.<br><br><i>A Treasury of Children's Songs</i> is an updated version of <i>Go In and Out the Window</i>, first published in 1987 and reprinted twelve times.<br><br></p><p>PreSchool-Grade 5-A beautifully produced abridgment of Go in and out the Window (Holt, 1987), which included 61 selections. These 40 songs appeared in that collection with the exact musical annotation and, at times, matched with the same paintings. As in Go in, there is commentary on the art chosen to illustrate each piece. The selections include classic folksongs such as "Red River Valley," "Home on the Range," and "Shenandoah," as well as childhood favorites such as "London Bridge," "Lazy Mary," and "The Mulberry Bush." The art on the front cover and typeface, as attractive and lavish as in the first book, suggest a younger audience. While Treasury is not an essential purchase for libraries that own the earlier title, it's a lovely addition for larger collections, especially those with wide and varied music sections.<br><i>Jane Marino, Bronxville Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Anthony Burgess&#39; infamous nightmare vision of youth culture in revolt, fifteen-year-old Alex and his friends set out on a diabolical orgy of robbery, rape, torture and murder. Alex is jailed for his teenage delinquency and the State tries to reform him - but at what cost? Burgess writes of social prophecy and free will in this black comedy.</p><p>Anthony Burgess was born in Manchester in 1917. He studied English at Manchester University and joined the army in 1940 where he spent six years in the Education Corps. After demobilization, he worked first as a college lecturer in Speech and Drama and then as a grammar-school master before becoming an education officer in the Colonial Service, stationed in Malay and Borneo. In 1959 Burgess was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and decided to become a full-time writer. Despite being given less than a year to live, Burgess went on to write at least a book a year - including A Clockwork Orange (1962), M/F (1971), Man of Nazareth (1979), Earthly Powers (1980) and The Kingdom of the Wicked (1985) - and hundreds of book reviews right up until his death. He was also a prolific composer and produced many full-scale works for orchestra and other media during his lifetime. Anthony Burgess died in 1993.Anthony Burgess's 1963 novel was published with a glossary of the dystopian language used by Alex, the brutal teenage narrator. The quality of Tom Hollander's performance, however, renders such help unnecessary. Hollander's vocal suggestiveness, grasp of tone, and overall emotional resonance with the novel give listeners amazing clarity (especially if, like this reviewer, they've previously read the book relying on the glossary). You listen to Alex's adventures, amazed at the clarity Hollander gives to such a verbally ambitious work. This recording also includes the last chapter of the novel (not published in the first American edition), Burgess's later introduction to the book, and, from the Caedmon archives, Burgess himself reading excerpts. A rich, exceptional package. G.H.

He lives in New Jersey.</p><b>ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Three minutes after she walked in the front door, Crissa had the manager and two clerks facedown on the floor, their hands bound behind them with plastic cuffs.<br>She took away their guns&#x2014;snub-noses in belt clip holsters&#x2014;and dumped them in the flip-top trash can against the wall. All three had been wearing their guns openly, but they hadn&#x2019;t gone for them. She&#x2019;d drawn the Glock, come around the counter fast, gesturing at the floor, and they&#x2019;d knelt without protest, hands behind their heads. They knew the drill, valued their lives more than the money.<br>She put the Glock away, went back and locked the front door. Rain slanted out of the gray sky, ran down the plate-glass window. Only 4:00 P.M., but nearly night already. They&#x2019;d turned on the neon sign that read CHECK CASHING MONEY TRANSFERS PAY DAY LOANS. She hit a wall switch and the sign buzzed, went dark. She flipped the old-fashioned door placard to CLOSED.<br>When she crossed behind the counter again, the men hadn&#x2019;t moved. All three were Latinos, one older and grayer, the manager. They were lying still, waiting it out.<br>She went through a door into the back room&#x2014;desk, filing cabinets, a big green Honeywell safe. The safe door was ajar, as expected. She found the breaker box on the wall, clicked everything to OFF. The office lights blinked out; the computer on the desk hummed and died.<br>At the metal fire door, she listened, heard the sound of an engine outside in the alley. She rapped twice with gloved knuckles. After a moment, there came an answering knock from outside. She set her hand on the panic bar, paused. If the rear door alarm was connected to a separate breaker box&#x2014;one she hadn&#x2019;t found&#x2014;they were in trouble.<br>She took a breath, pushed. The lock clicked open, the door swung out. Charlie Glass loomed in the rain, in a gray trench coat like hers, baseball cap pulled low. She stepped aside to let him in, saw the Toyota SUV in the alley, wipers on, cargo door open, Smitty at the wheel.<br>Glass knelt in front of the safe without speaking, took a canvas bag from his coat and shook it open.<br>She went back out to where the men lay. One of the clerks twisted his face from the floor to look at her. The manager hissed something at him.<br><i>&#x201c;Silencio,&#x201d;</i> she said. <i>&#x201c;No se mueva.&#x201d;</i><br>She went to the window, looked out. The rain was coming down harder, bouncing off the sidewalk. No one walking around out there. Cars splashed by with their headlights on.<br>A short whistle from the back. She said, <i>&#x201c;Rel�jese. Es casi sobre,&#x201d;</i> to the men on the floor and went into the back room again.<br>The bag was open on the desk, half full of banded stacks of cash. Glass was using a screwdriver to pry open the tray of the DVR recorder on a shelf. It was fed by three surveillance cameras, two in the front, the other back here. She looked around, saw the second recorder on another shelf, in an opposite corner near the floor. She&#x2019;d missed it the first time.<br>&#x201c;Backup,&#x201d; she said, and pointed. He nodded, popped the disc from the open tray. While he worked on the second one, she began opening filing cabinets. The third was full of silver DVDs in slim plastic cases, dates written on them in black marker.<br>&#x201c;Got &#x2019;em,&#x201d; she said. She&#x2019;d been in the store a week earlier, would be on that day&#x2019;s surveillance disc. She took all of them to be sure, spilling them into the bag atop the money. He dropped the other two discs in, drew the bag&#x2019;s drawstrings tight, hefted it on his shoulder.<br>They went out into the rain. Glass tossed the bag into the rear of the SUV, got in behind it, and pulled the cargo door shut. She went around to the passenger side, climbed up. Smitty pulled away without a word. When they reached the end of the alley, he switched his headlights on and made a left onto the street.<br>&#x201c;Any problems?&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She slipped off the long dark wig, folded it carefully, put it inside the black plastic garbage bag at her feet. She flipped down the visor and looked in the mirror there, ran her fingers through her close-cropped hair where the wig had flattened it.<br>They were on a busy street, early rush hour traffic slowed by the rain. Smitty stopped at a red light, and they sat there, the only sound the clicking of the wipers. He began to tap stubby gloved fingers on the wheel, looked up at the light. He was a mechanic, had stolen the SUV the day before from a long-term lot at the airport. The theft likely hadn&#x2019;t been discovered yet, but she knew there was always the risk, the window of exposure before they were safe again.<br>She leaned over the seat. Glass lay under a blanket in back, the bag in there with him. He was black, bald, and six-four, hard to miss. He&#x2019;d stay out of sight until they were clear of the city.<br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A little longer.&#x201d;<br>When the light changed, they went up a block, then turned onto the big yellow bridge that spanned the Monongahela. A cargo barge chugged along far below them, wake churning behind it. Rain swept the surface of the river.<br>She powered the window down halfway, felt the wet wind on her face, took her first deep breath since she&#x2019;d walked into the store. She let it out easy, closed her eyes, willed her heartbeat to slow.<br>&#x201c;Man, do I need to take a piss,&#x201d; Smitty said.<br>When she opened her eyes after a while, they were in the hills, trees on both sides of the road. She rolled her neck to work the stiffness out, adjusted the dashboard vents so the heat blew directly on her legs.<br>&#x201c;I mean a <i>serious </i>piss,&#x201d; Smitty said.<br>She looked behind them, no cars. A sign ahead said WELCOME TO MOON TOWNSHIP.<br>Five minutes later, they pulled into the gas station, stopping alongside the cracked concrete isle where pumps had once been. She got out, the wind pulling at her, went to the closed bay doors. She caught the handle at the bottom of the right-hand door, heaved up until it was at chest level, then ducked through.<br>Inside was as they&#x2019;d left it. Her rented Taurus and Glass&#x2019;s Acura were parked side by side in the other bay, noses out. She pushed the door up the rest of the way, stepped aside as Smitty drove in. When he shut the engine off, she caught the handle, using her weight to drag the door closed.<br>Smitty left the headlights on, got out. He&#x2019;d found this place for them, the station abandoned for years, the lifts and hydraulic equipment gone, rusted parts and old tires left behind. She opened the back latch, and Glass climbed out with the bag. Smitty went to the far wall, unzipped, and began to urinate loudly against the concrete.<br>Glass thumped the bag onto the hood.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have a look,&#x201d; she said.<br>He set the DVDs aside, and they counted the money together, passing it between them, lining up the stacks on the still-warm hood. Smitty came back, zipping up.<br>&#x201c;Ninety-four five,&#x201d; she said when they were done.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the same,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;Shit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ninety-four?&#x201d; Smitty said. &#x201c;Are you sure? I thought we were talking close to three hundred?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I was told,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what happened.&#x201d;<br>Crissa looked at the money. Thirty-one five take-home. Hardly worth the trip. No wonder they&#x2019;d given it up so easy.<br>&#x201c;I could tell it wasn&#x2019;t three hundred when I started pulling it out of the safe,&#x201d; Glass said, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t want to say anything until we counted it. They must have moved some money, made a deposit the night before.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Or they had another safe somewhere else,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and we missed it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;God damn it,&#x201d; Smitty said.<br>&#x201c;A Friday,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;They should have been flush. I need to get with my guy, find out what happened.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;God damn it,&#x201d; Smitty said again.<br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get moving.&#x201d;<br>She disassembled the Glock, dropped the parts into an open fifty-five-gallon drum of waste oil against the wall, watched them sink. It was the only weapon any of them had carried.<br>Glass was dividing the money into three piles on the hood, using rubber bands on the loose bills. She popped the trunk of the Taurus, took out an overnight bag. Glass had gotten his own suitcase from the Acura and opened it on the floor. He began filling it with cash. Smitty was still looking at his share of the money on the hood.<br>&#x201c;Count it all you want,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to change. Way it goes sometimes. Nothing for it.&#x201d;<br>She put her share of the money into the bag, zipped it shut, and carried it back to the Taurus. It went into the trunk alongside another suitcase. Folded beside it was her thigh-length leather coat. She took off the trench coat, dropped it in, put on the leather, and shut the lid.<br>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t turn out the way we planned,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but that was good work. Both of you.&#x201d;<br>Smitty loaded his money into a canvas gym bag. Glass stowed his suitcase in the Acura&#x2019;s trunk.<br>&#x201c;This got fucked up,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s on me. But this isn&#x2019;t a bad thing we got going.&#x201d;<br>She looked at him.<br>&#x201c;You going in front, all innocent like that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s under control before they even know what happened. You stick around out here, we can do some more work.&#x201d;<br>She shook her head.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re breaking up a good thing,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Some other time.&#x201d;<br>She found a rusted brake shoe, got the bag with the wig out. She dropped the shoe in, tied the top of the bag, and sank it in the waste oil.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the discs with me,&#x201d; Glass...</p><h2>Tracing Your Irish Ancestors, Third Edition</h2><p>The new edition has been revised to include more broadly relevant material, such as a listing of copies of Roman Catholic records, covering dates, locations and formats. This edition also includes details of the Family History Centres of the Mormon Church, one of the world&#39;s richest genealogical archives.</p><p>John Grenham is a professional genealogist. He was formerly attached to the Genealogical Office in Dublin and later was a project manager with the Irish Genealogical Project (IGP).Grenham's new edition builds on its predecessor's excellent coverage of Irish genealogical sources. As in the first edition (LJ 1/93), a brief introduction to initiating a research project is followed by a discussion of the major sources. Although Grenham broadened the scope of this edition to include information about the holdings of the Family History Library and other repositories in Ireland, libraries should not discard the first edition, as it contains a large amount of data not to be found in the second. For instance, the new edition includes listings of Roman Catholic parish records rather than the Church of Ireland parish records listings that were part of the first edition. Information about manuscripts in the Genealogical Office and a list of family histories located in the National Library of Ireland are also omitted. Libraries that own James Ryan's outstanding Irish Records (Ancestry, 1997) will still want to purchase this book for its updated information. Recommended for all collections. Milner, a professional researcher and speaker, and Jonas, president of the British Isles Family History Society, offer their combined expertise to those in search of their English heritage. Geared more toward beginners than Mark Herber's Ancestral Trails (LJ 3/1/98), this starts with an excellent review of the basics of research and the procedures to acquire information from stateside libraries, LDS Family History Centers, and the Internet. Several chapters then address specific, complex sorts of records. Copious examples give readers an idea of what to expect. Icons point out tips, reminders, and case studies, and brief bibliographies for further reading are found throughout the book. For its thorough introduction and its direct approach to sometimes challenging records, this book is highly recommended for all libraries.DElaine M. Kuhn, Allen Cty. P.L., Ft.

Jane quickly creates a new life for Mary and jumps back on Timmy's case...not knowing that the two are fatefully linked to one calculating killer.</p><p>One of the reasons that I love Thomas Perry's Jane Whitfield books is that they are filled with so much arcane information about the darker side of life. Perry fills you in on how to fabricate a life, steal a car, or set up a bank account using someone else's Social Security Number. This is why I read books. I am way too much of a nice girl to find these things out on my own. Jane Whitfield is a nice girl with an edge. A Native American from Upstate New York, Jane takes people with problems and helps them to disappear. She gets them out of trouble and sets them up in a new life. In DANCE FOR THE DEAD, Jane rescues two "clients," a small boy whose millionaire parents have been killed and a woman accused of embezzlement.
